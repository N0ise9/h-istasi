# Release-Candidate Identity Evidence

This directory retains portable, byte-identical copies of each published
candidate's `candidate.json` manifest and `candidate.ready.json` seal. The
generated current-status check verifies their hashes and cross-checks their
source, package, addon, toolchain, Workbench, and ready-seal identities.

These small tracked records are not substitutes for the immutable package and
raw evidence bundle. Proof attached to an active runtime candidate must consume
the exact candidate ID and aggregate package SHA-256 named by its manifest.
Rebuilding starts a new candidate directory and evidence chain; existing
records are not rewritten.
Repository attributes keep both JSON records on canonical LF endings so their
byte hashes remain stable across checkouts.

Runtime results are not appended to these sealed candidate directories. Each
candidate-aware runner writes a fresh external sidecar run whose portable
envelope binds raw-file hashes to candidate, package, manifest, ready seal,
harness, runtime-tool, result, and cleanup identities. Only a deliberately
selected portable summary may later be tracked here.

If a package defect requires a rebuild, the older record remains byte-identical
and is described as retained superseded evidence. It remains available for
archive validation and consumer preflight, but not current runtime proof. No
result from that package may be combined with the replacement candidate's
evidence chain.

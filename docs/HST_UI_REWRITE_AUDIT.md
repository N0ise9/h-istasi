# h-istasi UI Rewrite Audit

Date: 2026-06-25

This audit tracks the current UI rewrite state against the layout-driven Enfusion UI goal. Classifications use the requested buckets: Allowed, Needs conversion helper, Should move to layout file, and Should be deleted.

## Coordinate Policy

Required policy:

- Raw workspace pixels are for `CreateWidgetInWorkspace` only.
- Layout coordinates come from `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.GetLayoutSize`.
- Raw/layout conversion goes through `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.LayoutToRawPx` and `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.RawToLayoutPx`.
- Map projection coordinates may use `SCR_MapEntity.WorldToScreen`, then convert projected raw screen coordinates through `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.RawToLayoutPx`.

Current state:

- `Scripts/Game/HST/Services/HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.c` owns raw/layout size helpers and raw/layout conversion helpers.
- `DebugWorkspaceMetrics` logs raw size, layout size, and effective DPI scale once per UI source.
- Main UI entry points now call the debug helper for setup map, command menu, shared notification toast, mission report dialogs, and loadout editor.
- `HST_UIDebug` logs created layout roots, expected widget presence, expected widget screen bounds, z-order, opacity, flags, row samples, and data population summaries so runtime test logs can identify hidden, zero-sized, off-screen, or mis-stacked layout widgets.
- `HST_UIRootService` owns current-screen, modal-screen, notification, topmost ownership, and modal-aware open/refresh arbitration so blocking screens cannot open underneath unrelated modals and keyboard input can ignore screens hidden under a modal. It logs every open, close, refused open, ignored close, and notification depth change with current/modal/topmost state and root widget geometry.

## File Audit

| File | Current uses | Classification | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Scripts/Game/HST/Services/HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.c` | `workspace.GetWidth`, `workspace.GetHeight`, `DPIUnscale`, `DPIScale` | Allowed | This is the central conversion boundary. Keep direct DPI calls here. |
| `Scripts/Game/HST/Components/HST_SetupMapComponent.c` | Workspace-parented native map layout creation, setup-map ready diagnostics, `ScreenToWorld`, centralized modal/prompt z-order, native map dialog cursor state, passive prompt flags, setup confirmation modal registration, signature-gated setup zone/candidate overlay publication | Allowed with guardrails | `ScreenToWorld` is allowed only after viewport readiness checks. Keep modal buttons widget-driven. Setup confirmation is registered as a setup-owned modal in the shared UI root. Setup zones and the temporary candidate marker publish through the passive map overlay component and must remain signature-gated. The setup component must not keep its own overlay dirty/redraw loop, OS cursor forcing, cursor proxy widgets, or extra dialog input contexts over the native map. |
| `Scripts/Game/HST/Map/HST_MapZoneOverlayUIComponent.c` | `WorldToScreen`, `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.RawToLayoutPx` projection conversion, viewport-change-gated redraws, canvas circle/line/text widgets with `IGNORE_CURSOR`/`NOFOCUS` | Allowed for map overlay | This is the explicit map projection boundary. Redraws are coalesced behind revision and pan/zoom threshold checks, and projection-not-ready frames no longer recreate widgets. Keep overlays passive and separate from marker lifecycle. |
| `Scripts/Game/HST/Components/HST_CommandMenuComponent.c` | Persistent layout root, deterministic shell layer ordering, named region binding, row layout population, layout-owned scroll hosts and row resources, action-confirmation data handoff, topmost-aware keyboard input | Allowed with guardrails | Main shell and rows are layout-driven and command-menu blocking state is registered only after the layout root exists. Runtime data refreshes reuse the existing root and clear only dynamic row containers. Script no longer builds absolute panel placement metrics. Destructive/admin actions pass data into `HST_ActionDialogController`; keep new command-menu sections in layout files and named row resources rather than reintroducing generic canvas/text factories. |
| `Scripts/Game/HST/Components/HST_CommandMenuRequestComponent.c` | No UI geometry matches in audit grep | Allowed | Request bridge can remain behavior-only. |
| `Scripts/Game/HST/Components/HST_LoadoutEditorComponent.c` | Layout root, named region binding, centralized preview/UI layer ordering, layout-owned left Back/ESC controls, layout-owned mode tabs, layout-owned preview drag surface, layout-owned preview status/toast text, shared passive toast action hints, layout-owned storage category tabs, layout-owned row preview chrome and fallback text, layout-owned row preview cell anchors, layout-owned storage volume progress bar, layout-owned left slot/storage rail shell and scroll hosts, layout-owned candidate/template/settings panel shell and controls, layout-owned footer hint slots, layout-owned storage add-items panel shell/grid, row layout population, preview world, dynamic preview contents, topmost-aware keyboard input | Mixed | Major shell regions, left controls, mode tabs, preview drag capture, preview status/toast text, action feedback, storage category tabs, row preview chrome/fallback text, row preview cell anchors, storage volume track/fill, left rail chrome, candidate/template/settings panels, footer hints, and the right add-items panel are layout-owned or shared-controller owned. Core chrome is explicitly visible by default in the layout, while mode-specific panels are hidden by default and shown by script. Blocking state is registered only after the editor layout root exists, and `ApplyLoadoutLayerOrder` reasserts the render-target/UI sibling order after render and delayed layout refresh. Script no longer builds a safe-rect, absolute panel placement model, screen-percentage panel metrics, or viewport-scaled fallback panel dimensions; it keeps font scale and fixed layout-coordinate fallbacks only until named regions can be measured. |
| `Scripts/Game/HST/Components/HST_MissionClientComponent.c` | Mission detail data selection, notification enqueue calls, report-dialog open/close delegation | Allowed with guardrails | Mission report details now hand `HST_ReportDialogData` to the shared report dialog controller instead of creating named widgets locally. Notifications go through the shared passive toast controller. Future mission action/admin flows should pass data into `HST_ActionDialogController`. |
| `Scripts/Game/HST/UI/HST_ActionDialogController.c` | Action dialog layout creation, action-dialog modal root registration, named text population, cancel/confirm binding, layout diagnostics | Allowed | Owns the shared confirmation modal widget lifecycle for command and future mission/admin flows. Components should provide only owner/debug IDs, text, and button callback IDs. The layout uses real button hit targets with passive sibling labels, and the UI root records it as `ACTION_DIALOG` instead of conflating it with mission reports. |
| `Scripts/Game/HST/UI/HST_ReportDialogController.c` | Report dialog layout creation, modal root registration, named text population, objective row layout population, close-button binding, layout diagnostics | Allowed | Owns the mission report dialog widget lifecycle and debug output. Keep mission report UI changes here or in layout resources; mission clients should only provide data and callbacks. The layout uses a real close hit target with a passive sibling label. |
| `Scripts/Game/HST/UI/HST_NotificationToastController.c` | Passive top-centered toast layout creation, queueing, duration dismissal, UI-root notification state | Allowed | Owns notification widget lifetime for mission and command callers. Keeps notifications non-modal and cursor-ignored while preventing stale dismiss timers from clearing newer toasts. Toast title geometry uses negative fixed-height bottom bounds so delayed ready diagnostics do not report negative height. |
| `Scripts/Game/HST/Services/HST_MapMarkerService.c` | No UI geometry matches in audit grep | Allowed | Native marker service should remain marker-record orchestration only. |
| `Scripts/Game/HST/Map/HST_CampaignMapMarkerDirector.c` | No UI geometry matches in audit grep | Allowed | Desired marker record builder is correctly separated from UI projection. |
| `Scripts/Game/HST/Map/HST_NativeMapMarkerReconciler.c` | No UI geometry matches in audit grep | Allowed | Native map marker reconciler owns native marker lifecycle, not UI widgets. |
| `UI/layouts/HST_SetupHQMap.layout` | Native setup map shell | Allowed | Setup-only layout. Keep separated from gameplay map config. |
| `UI/layouts/HST_SetupConfirmModal.layout` | Full-screen dim modal root with native fixed-size centered `Dialog` child and real `NoButton` / `YesButton` | Allowed | Button behavior must remain widget-handler based. The modal is created as top-level setup chrome above the native map root and owns outside-click swallowing itself; no separate blocker layout should be reintroduced. |
| `UI/layouts/HST_LoadoutEditor.layout` | Full-screen preview and named UI regions | Allowed, still expanding | Add dedicated tab/button/panel row layouts as script factories are retired. |
| `Configs/Map/HST_SetupHQMap.conf` | Setup-only native map config with setup cursor module, marker UI, zone overlay component, and `PLAIN` map mode | Allowed for setup only | Used only by `HST_SetupMapComponent`; keep setup selection behavior and setup-only zone overlays out of gameplay. It must not use `FULLSCREEN`, because `SCR_MapEntity.SetupMapConfig` caches by map mode and can otherwise reuse setup UI components for the normal map. |
| `Configs/Map/HST_GameplayMap.conf` | Gameplay map config inheriting vanilla `MapFullscreen.conf` | Allowed | Keeps normal map tools and marker UI through the vanilla config instead of copying setup UI components. The game mode map config component points its gadget map path here. |

## Allowed Uses

- `SetZOrder` on created root/layout widgets where it establishes stacking order.
- `WidgetFlags.IGNORE_CURSOR | WidgetFlags.NOFOCUS` for passive notifications, setup prompt, map overlays, and noninteractive visual children.
- `FrameSlot.SetPos` / `FrameSlot.SetSize` for widgets created by script into non-stretched slots, such as dynamic map overlay primitives.
- `ScreenToWorld` in setup map click handling after viewport readiness.
- `WorldToScreen` in the map overlay component, followed by `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.RawToLayoutPx`.

## Needs Conversion Helper

- Any future raw-to-layout measurement outside `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics` should move to `RawToLayoutPx` or a new helper on that service.
- Any future repeated scroll-container placement helpers should become layout widgets with named `Scroll` and `Items` children.
- Any future data-dependent row fill widths should use native value widgets or layout children, with script setting only value/visibility.
- Any future notification source should enqueue through `HST_NotificationToastController`, not create its own toast root.

## Should Move To Layout File

- Mission and command-menu action/admin confirmation flows should use `HST_ActionDialogController` and `HST_ActionDialog.layout` rather than ad hoc panels.
- No current loadout row geometry should move; storage volume now uses a native progress bar.

## Should Be Deleted

- Any reintroduced generic scripted panel root after mission detail/report dialogs moved to named layouts.
- Any invisible coordinate hit-test logic for visible buttons.
- Any new direct `workspace.DPIUnscale` / `workspace.DPIScale` calls outside `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.c`.
- Any full-screen blockers except explicit modal roots with visible, usable dialog content.

## Runtime Checkpoint 2026-06-25

- `HST_UIRootService.RequestOpen` is now idempotent for identical current/modal roots so repeated setup-map refreshes do not spam root-state transitions or revision churn.
- Setup map, setup prompt, setup confirm modal, command menu, and loadout editor top-level layouts are created with the workspace as parent and now emit delayed `*_ready` geometry logs after layout has had a chance to resolve from creation-time `0x0` bounds.
- Setup confirmation modal text/button labels are script-populated after creation and after the delayed layout refresh. The label widgets are siblings over the real buttons instead of children inside button widgets.
- Setup confirmation modal Yes/No activation is guarded by widget id, mouse button, and frame serial so `OnClick` plus `OnMouseButtonUp` cannot submit or cancel the same setup choice twice.
- Setup confirmation now suppresses HQ selection by clearing map location-selection cursor state and entering native map dialog cursor state with `SCR_MapCursorModule.HandleDialog(true)`. It does not force `WidgetManager.SetCursor`, create cursor proxy widgets, or activate extra dialog input contexts.
- Map zone/candidate overlays now route projected raw map coordinates through `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.RawToLayoutPx`, keeping direct DPI conversion centralized while preserving `WorldToScreen` as the map projection boundary.
- Setup prompt, notification title, and command-menu fixed-height chrome use negative fixed-height bottom bounds; positive fixed-height bottom values resolved as negative runtime heights in the latest setup and toast diagnostics.
- Setup confirmation modal dialog sizing now uses a full-screen frame root with a passive dimmer and the same centered `SizeX`/`SizeY` plus alignment pattern as the working action/report dialogs.
- Command menu close-button hierarchy no longer puts a child frame inside `CloseButton`, removing the runtime GUI error seen in the latest log.
- Command menu uses `ApplyCommandMenuLayerOrder` after creation, population, and delayed layout refresh so the dimmer, surface, panels, header, button, and label stack consistently without geometry offsets.
- Command menu now keeps one workspace-parented layout root while open and clears only `TabItems`, `MainItems`, `ActivityItems`, and `ActionsItems` during snapshot refreshes. This avoids rebuilding the whole shell under active input or server updates.
- Command menu nav/stats/main/activity/action panel slots now use resolved-bounds-safe offset signs, preventing the left nav from collapsing negative and the center/right columns from expanding through sibling panels.
- Command menu widget activation is now guarded by widget id, mouse button, and frame serial so `OnClick` plus `OnMouseButtonUp` cannot double-fire tabs, close, action rows, or command action-dialog buttons.
- Mission report close activation uses the same duplicate guard, keeping modal close state transitions single-shot.
- Loadout editor uses `ApplyLoadoutLayerOrder` after render and delayed layout refresh to keep the render target low, the UI layer above it, the preview drag surface behind panels, and expanded `loadout_editor_ready` geometry logs for the next test pass.
- Command menu and loadout editor delayed ready logs now include child samples for dynamic list hosts so runtime logs show whether populated rows landed inside the expected scroll/list container after anchors resolve.
- Loadout editor layout now explicitly marks core chrome visible by default and mode-specific panels hidden by default, so the layout's baseline state matches the script's mode population model.
- Loadout editor top/left fixed same-anchor slots now use negative far-edge coordinates, while stretched panel interiors use positive far-edge margins. Runtime ready logs had shown the top tabs, left buttons, left rail, footer, and mode panels resolving to negative sizes while the render target stayed visible.
- Loadout editor left Back/ESC buttons and footer hint children also use signed fixed-child bounds so the chrome can become visible without leaving the actual controls or hint labels in negative child slots.
- Setup candidate marker changed from a cross to a small temporary dot/ring marker overlay, keeping setup selection separate from persistent gameplay marker lifecycle.
- Setup map now uses a distinct non-fullscreen map mode and the world map config component explicitly points the normal gadget map at `HST_GameplayMap.conf`, preventing setup's minimal map UI component stack from being reused by the normal gameplay map.
- Shared notification, action-dialog, and report-dialog roots now use workspace-parented layout creation and emit delayed `*_ready` geometry logs, matching the setup/command/loadout chrome lifecycle.
- Action confirmation modals now register with the UI root as `ACTION_DIALOG`; mission reports remain `MISSION_DIALOG`, keeping command/admin confirmations separate from mission detail screens in root-state logs.
- Setup no longer runs its own overlay dirty/redraw loop. It publishes setup zone/candidate content changes, and `HST_MapZoneOverlayUIComponent` owns projection/redraw timing from content revisions and map viewport changes.

## Remaining Acceptance Gaps

- Runtime-QA root service input blocking across setup, command menu, loadout, mission dialogs, and notifications.
- Re-test command menu and loadout editor delayed ready logs for any remaining `negative=` or offscreen panel entries after the slot sign correction.
- Wire any remaining mission-specific action/admin confirmation flows into `HST_ActionDialogController`.
- Continue reducing remaining mission action/admin areas without reintroducing command/loadout row geometry.
- Run in-game/Workbench QA at 1920x1080, 2560x1440 with 1920x1080 layout size, and ultrawide.

# h-istasi Architecture

## Runtime Ownership

`HST_CampaignCoordinatorComponent` is the server-side entry point. It owns a
single `HST_CampaignState` and delegates to small services:

- `HST_EconomyService`: HR, faction money, support, aggression, and war level.
- `HST_MissionService`: mission eligibility, activation, deadlines, and
  completion rewards.
- `HST_PersistenceService`: campaign save-data migration/tracking, native
  Reforger checkpoint requests, and autosave debouncing.
- `HST_AuthorizationService`: persistent members, guests, admins, and the
  first commander-vacancy policy.
- `HST_StrategicService`: ownership changes, town support, Petros penalties,
  activation flags, and victory evaluation.
- `HST_ArsenalService`: item counts, unlock thresholds, and abstract garage
  records.
- `HST_EnemyDirectorService`: validated spending against separate attack and
  support pools.
- `HST_PlayerLifecycleService`: connected-player registration, deterministic
  Workbench identity fallback, personal money, and rank.
- `HST_TownService`: resistance income, HR income, and town support changes.
- `HST_GarrisonService`: abstract garrison creation and survivor fold-back.
- `HST_RecruitmentService`: troop training and abstract garrison recruitment.
- `HST_ZoneCaptureService`: capture helpers around strategic ownership
  changes.
- `HST_PlayerSpawnService`: custom FIA HQ spawn, Workbench identity fallback,
  native respawn requests, pending spawn tracking, and spawned-player records.
- `HST_PhysicalWarService`: player-proximity zone activation over the
  abstract garrison model.
- `HST_GeneratedContentService`: generated Everon mission sites, roadblock,
  support, stash, crashsite, and route records derived from stable zone
  anchors.
- `HST_MissionObjectiveService`: rough mission objectives, campaign task state,
  and no-admin objective progress hooks for broad-alpha mission families.
- `HST_MissionRuntimeService`: physical MVP mission primitives, world-condition
  objective polling, runtime inspection, and cleanup state.
- `HST_SupportRequestService`: stateful FIA/enemy support calls, native-safe
  ground support activation, and abstract helicopter-style support records.
- `HST_CivilianService`: town reputation, wanted heat, police/roadblock
  presence, aid incidents, and per-player undercover records.
- `HST_EnemyCommanderService`: enemy resource spending into patrol, roadblock,
  QRF, counterattack, rebuild, and support-call orders.

The coordinator currently exposes server-only mutation methods that check
campaign phase, known IDs, and mission eligibility before changing state.
Client RPCs are intentionally withheld until player-owned request components
can authenticate the caller identity and enforce member, commander, and admin
permissions without trusting client-provided IDs.

## Authoring Contracts

The addon keeps authoring data separate from runtime state:

- `HST_CampaignPreset`: fixed scenario roles and capability switches.
- `HST_FactionTemplate`: faction identity and capability declarations.
- `HST_MapDefinition`: stable IDs for zones and hideout candidates.
- `HST_BalanceConfig`: Community Edition-derived initial values.
- `HST_MissionRegistryConfig`: mission definitions and deferred capabilities.

The checked-in `.conf` resources are the intended data source and are validated
against the runtime fallback catalog. The current coordinator still uses the
matching fallback catalog while Workbench-safe resource loading and serializer
prefabs are connected.

## Persistence

The persistence service tracks `HST_CampaignSaveData` through
`PersistenceSystem`, applies restored state through a schema migration path,
and flushes the tracked scripted state before requesting
`SaveGameManager.RequestSavePoint` when saving is possible and allowed. The
state model is versioned from day one. `HST_CampaignSaveData` is the deep-copy
save container for current campaign fields and nested runtime arrays,
including generated content, objectives, mission runtime, active groups,
support, enemy order, civilian, and undercover records. Save compatibility
still needs Workbench restart/load soak testing before it is promised to
players.

## World Layout

`Worlds/HST_Everon/HST_Everon.ent` is an original subscene over vanilla
Everon. Named layer files reserve ownership boundaries for physical authoring.
Strategic IDs live in `Configs/HST/Maps/HST_Everon.conf` so persistence does
not depend on fragile entity names.

The checked-in world shells include a base-backed AI world with explicit Eden
soldier and vehicle navmesh configs, a perception manager, faction, loadout,
radio, chat, and respawn managers so Workbench can initialize without relying
on Conflict's strategic brain.

Direct `.ent` Play mode no longer depends on the stock Deployment Setup menu.
The coordinator is an `SCR_BaseGameModeComponent`, so it receives game-mode
state and player-connected callbacks directly. It also runs a short frame sweep
for connected players without controlled pawns, which covers Workbench timing
where player `1` exists before its respawn component is ready. The respawn
system remains as possession plumbing, but its spawn logic is
`HST_PlayerSpawnLogic`, which delegates to `HST_PlayerSpawnService`. The
service registers the connected player as FIA, submits an `SCR_FreeSpawnData`
request for the default FIA rifleman at the selected HQ hideout, tracks the
request as pending, and records player state only when the native spawn
callback reports success. This prevents the Workbench frame sweep from
creating duplicate bodies while Reforger is still finalizing ownership.

`StartingPoints.layer` still contains FIA-affiliated Scenario Framework
spawnpoint slots and FIA role-selection loadouts, but those are now authoring
metadata and a debug fallback, not the normal player-side path. US
remains the occupier in the strategic preset. Game Master-spawned characters
are still not expected to advance h-istasi's player lifecycle. Workbench
offline play may log blank identity ID errors from stock reconnect or
editable-entity systems; treat those as non-blocking if a character is spawned
and possessed.

`HST_HQService` owns the server-side HQ lifecycle: setup-driven initial hideout
selection, HQ movement between authored hideouts, Petros/cache/arsenal/tent
runtime positions, and Petros-loss penalties. Runtime Petros spawning tries the
custom h-istasi prefab first through its GUID-qualified metadata resource and
falls back to the base FIA character only if that resource cannot spawn. The HQ
arsenal uses a GUID-indexed HST supply-cache prefab whose contextual actions
open the same Arsenal/Loot menu path used by the I-key menu, with a stock FIA
cache fallback if the custom object cannot spawn.

The alpha HQ menu is procedural rather than layout-resource loaded. The server
keeps the existing `HST_MENU`, `TAB`, `STATUS`, `RESULT`, and `ACTION` payload
lines while adding optional `STAT`, `SECTION`, `ROW`, and `FEED` lines for the
Antistasi-style overview, HQ/Petros, missions, map/war, forces, arsenal/loot,
members, and admin panels. Contextual Petros and HQ arsenal actions call the
same request bridge as menu clicks so local hosts and MP clients follow one
server-authoritative command path.

## Antistasi Framework Spine

The first campaign loop is a hybrid. Zones carry type, position, income,
support, activation radius, route IDs, mission site IDs, and garrison-slot data
in `HST_CampaignState`; garrisons are stored as infantry and vehicle counts.
The physical-war service marks zones active when players enter their
activation radius, converts abstract garrison counts into route-aware active
groups, and folds survivor counts back before deactivation. Broad-alpha
services generate mission sites/routes, attach objectives/tasks to started
missions, poll physical MVP mission primitives from world conditions, spend
enemy pools into orders/support calls, and track civilian/undercover state.
Mission success, failure, and timeout paths mutate economy, support, capture
progress, and aggression state. Coordinator hooks expose deterministic
server-only actions for Workbench tests and no-admin player actions for setup,
random missions, support requests/cancel, civilian aid, looting, income,
training, recruitment, and HQ moves.

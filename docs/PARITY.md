# h-istasi Capability Map

The current sealed campaign source/Workbench checkpoint keeps Campaign
persistence at Schema 64 and advances runtime settings from Schema 23 to 24 for
the Blueprint Phase 8 ambient-runtime slice. It adds capped and fairly rotated
physical town population, bounded spawn/readiness/recovery lifecycle, stable
runtime vehicle identity, and a transient-versus-claimed save boundary. It
identifies implementation
`6afadc7c13681b78171939a740862e52328beffd`, UTC
`2026-07-12T15:57:55Z`, and label
`schema64-settings24-ambient-runtime-authority`. Final sealed-tree evidence is
Foundation at 711 script-symbol references plus normal Workbench compilation
and all-five-configuration validation at 5,799 files/11,718 classes with CRC
`bb083672`, explicit validation success, zero HST script errors, and zero
surviving Workbench processes. Static source checks plus Workbench compile/
validation pass; deterministic proof services are
compiled and wired but have not executed in Campaign Debug. This is not native
runtime proof.
Packaged runtime, real save/restart, rendered UI, ten-town/ten-minute stutter/
churn/performance soak, and multiplayer execution remain pending.

The preceding sealed checkpoint is Campaign Schema 64 on runtime-settings
Schema 23. It introduces one canonical curated-town support/population record,
separate FIA/occupier/invader basis-point authority, strict political hysteresis
through the existing ownership-transition service, explicit town contact, and
deterministic Map/War political projections. Legacy town support/population
fields are migration/read-only projections. That checkpoint identifies
implementation `6f3c913eaed66926cce38b2ecafcff94084898a3`, UTC
`2026-07-12T11:28:41Z`, and label `schema64-canonical-town-influence`.
Foundation passes for it at 696 script-symbol references.

Schema 63 is an earlier sealed source/Workbench checkpoint. It identifies implementation
`85a75c65e9c148a890d8d78b0288ae6483a5ccd9`, UTC
`2026-07-12T08:22:05Z`, and label
`schema63-canonical-combat-presence`.

Schema 62 is an earlier sealed canonical-ownership checkpoint under implementation
`7c93e0a485bcabe5a364c0b0cfeca235accb50f7`, UTC
`2026-07-12T06:11:19Z`, and label
`schema62-canonical-ownership-transition`. Foundation passes with 670 script-
symbol references. Headless Workbench Game validation loaded 5,785 files/11,652
classes with CRC `22c13a32` and zero script errors; the normal Script Editor open
remained responsive without a crash, and zero Workbench processes survived the
test. Schema 61 is the preceding sealed marker-projection foundation. Campaign
Debug and packaged-runtime gates remain open.

## Implemented Foundation

- Typed versioned campaign state
- Fixed FIA versus US versus USSR preset
- Campaign resource pools, HR, money, support, aggression, and war-level
  service surface
- Persistent member, guest, admin, commander-vacancy, player lifecycle,
  town-support, income, arsenal, vehicle-cargo, saved-loadout, issued-item,
  garage-record, runtime-vehicle, abstract-garrison, recruitment, and
  enemy-pool service surfaces
- Common mission lifecycle and configured mission-registry baseline
- Native Reforger manual and periodic checkpoint requests with
  `PersistenceSystem` tracking for the scripted campaign save container
- Original Everon world shell and stable strategic-zone IDs
- Custom FIA HQ player spawn path that bypasses stock Deployment Setup and
  uses game-mode player callbacks, a short spawn sweep, native respawn
  requests, pending spawn tracking, and spawn-success callbacks
- FIA Scenario Framework spawnpoints and role-selection loadouts retained as
  authoring metadata and fallback scaffolding
- HQ lifecycle service for setup-driven initial hideout selection, HQ
  movement, Petros state, Petros/cache/tent runtime object positions,
  Petros-loss penalties, HQ knowledge/threat, and Defend Petros state
- Versioned campaign save container for current state fields and nested arrays,
  with schema migration and restored-state application helpers
- Campaign authority foundation through sealed Schema 64, built on sealed
  Schema 63, with persisted monotonic IDs,
  typed command receipts, resource transactions, exact force quotes/manifests,
  durable per-projection SpawnQueue state, bounded accepted-settlement replay
  tombstones, separately typed exact player QRF/Search-and-Destroy and enemy-QRF
  operations, exact convoy/patrol/mission-guard/rescue operations, and durable
  radio-site lifecycle, marker-record revision/tombstone/source-revision state,
  one marker-projection epoch/global sequence, a bounded authoritative client
  stream, and durable revisioned ownership-transition receipts/backlinks
- Sealed Schema-63 crew-aware combat presence: one shared state-only query
  and per-zone heat service consumes fresh registered physical samples or
  eligible durable virtual infantry. Conscious dismounted infantry, operational
  occupied armed mobile platforms, and operational occupied static weapons
  contribute; cargo, empty vehicles, destroyed/burning platforms, immobile
  mobile platforms, terminal/quarantined rows, and stale samples do not. Capture,
  missions, HQ threat, civilian safety, and enemy strategy share the same
  result. Zone diagnostics persist `HOT -> COOLING -> COLD` with a
  runtime-settings Schema-23 default of 30 seconds. Restore invalidates physical
  samples and fails malformed/pre-63 heat conservatively to `COLD`. Spawned
  groups with unresolved physical authority invalidate affected queries, and
  capture excludes spectator/Game Master proxies by requiring a living conscious
  character player. Contribution, authority-gap, and zone/radius caches share an
  indexed physical runtime registry and reusable scratch buffers. Foundation,
  normal Workbench compile/create, and explicit five-configuration Script
  validation pass; runtime execution remains open.
- Sealed Schema-64 canonical town influence: one revisioned record per
  curated town owns separate FIA, occupier, and invader support in basis points,
  initial/remaining/destroyed population, contact/activity, event aggregates,
  and pending ownership intent. The formula is pinned to commit
  `6e4226d3863ca8673535386c2fff8b6e08a806c4`; raw `+1` at populations
  100/25/400 yields `+100`/`+200`/`+50` basis points. Resistance requires
  strictly `>8000`, enemy ownership strictly `<4000`, and both equality
  boundaries remain neutral. Every flip delegates to the Schema-62 ownership
  service. Pre-64 migration reconciles legacy facts once; malformed current
  authority quarantines at `-64`. Exact events preserve population before and
  after, authorized absolute seeds are idempotent events, and restore validates
  the chain through the final record. Foundation and Workbench compile/
  validation pass; Campaign Debug and runtime proof remain open.
- Sealed Schema-64 Map/War projection: Zone Pressure contains only valid
  explicitly contacted towns, with the current town first and stable FIA-
  support/name/ID ordering after it. Resistance Territory includes the complete
  published resistance-owned strategic set in type/name/ID order and shares the
  marker projection's completed-parent publication fence. Simon's Wood remains
  ambient-only, and the Maiden's Bay Logistics Warehouse remains nonpolitical.
- Sealed source/Workbench Blueprint Phase 8 ambient runtime on Settings Schema
  24: global actor
  and traffic caps combine base, per-player, war-level, population, time-of-day,
  and heat policy before physical projection. Deterministic 120-second-or-longer
  leases and a separate reconcile cursor rotate scarce capacity fairly. Normal
  updates begin at most four root-spawn transactions, including initial static
  roots. Combined pedestrian/driver demand is capped to the unique valid
  appearance pool and exhaustion fails closed rather than cloning a locality
  actor. Pedestrian
  and traffic transactions wait for exact native group/waypoint and pilot/
  engine/route readiness; immutable per-zone/kind slots drive distinct bounded
  recovery routes and recycling. Static military ambience refreshes on owner/
  policy changes through the same cap, and the scoped Campaign Debug Phase 20
  helper consumes the production global plan and four-root transaction-start
  cap. Session topology
  stays non-durable, unclaimed rows/cargo are filtered, and claimed or legacy-detached
  vehicles cross into durable field-vehicle authority. Player-first observation
  avoids a full ambient-root occupancy scan before persistence every server
  frame.
  Every `HST_PersistenceService` capture/checkpoint path repeats it behind a fail-
  closed reconciliation barrier, and new-campaign reset performs its own
  reconciliation. A shared tracker registers promotions, restored/adopted field
  vehicles, and garage redeploys for current transform, destruction, and cargo
  position. Saved durable IDs remain stable across restart rather than rekeying
  to process-local replication IDs; restore runs before first-frame claims and
  exact forward/reverse bindings own loot, garage, deletion, and undercover
  lookups. Garage redeploy tracks a fresh campaign ID before commit and rolls
  back root/row/cargo/binding on failure. Reset may retain only occupied live tracked `loot_vehicle`,
  `field_vehicle`, or `garage_redeploy` roots, normalizes retained rows to
  `field_vehicle`, copies their vehicle/cargo rows before state replacement, and
  deletes every other bound root once. Destroyed roots and dead controlled
  occupants cannot claim.
  Foundation and Workbench compile/validation pass under the sealed Settings-24
  identity above; it has no Campaign Debug, packaged, native brief enter/exit, autosave/restart,
  destruction/reset, two-nearby-same-prefab no-collapse restoration, or Campaign
  Debug Phase 20 execution result.
- One versioned `OperationRecord` for each newly confirmed exact paid player
  infantry QRF, plus conservative backfill for uniquely coherent accepted active
  schema-48 rows. It separates immutable origin/assignment from tactical target
  and persists typed duty, engagement, materialization, position, settlement,
  policy, terminal, execution-link, timing, revision, direct-route cursor,
  projection-decision, and virtual-combat authority. Schema 50 makes that one
  consumer travel while virtual, materialize/fold with hysteresis, preserve its
  exact living/dead slots, and fight only hostile abstract infantry at its target
  in bounded deterministic steps. Live physical combat-contact wiring,
  generalized vehicle/assets, broader encounter simulation, and generalized
  virtualization remain open; later bullets name each separately opted-in
  operation family rather than widening this Schema-50 contract.
  Four projection assertions join the existing eight operation-record
  assertions, but none is packaged runtime proof until executed there.
- Newly planned infantry-only enemy defensive QRFs are the second explicit
  version-1 operation type and the first exact enemy-order consumer. One
  distinct same-faction operational source, same-faction defended target under resistance pressure, prepaid frozen
  roster, order, operation, held batch, and active group remain linked through
  materialization/fold, once-only defensive pressure, return to origin, exact
  casualties, and survivor-proportional attack/support settlement. Six focused
  `enemy_qrf.*` assertions cover admission, legacy isolation, projection,
  settlement, restore, and rejection in source. Existing enemy orders and every
  other enemy order type remain contract version `0`.
- Newly started convoy missions are the third explicit version-1 operation type
  and the first narrow exact vehicle/multi-group consumer. One persisted
  generated road route, exactly three vehicle slots, three crew groups and
  ordered crew slots, plus optional cargo/captive assigned to vehicle zero stay
  linked through virtual travel, proximity materialization, physical
  interception, clear-contact fold, casualty-preserving rematerialization,
  route-authoritative arrival, and existing once-only convoy outcomes.
  Frozen slot/entity identity retains the exact member that died rather than
  choosing casualties from a count.
  Destroyed/captured vehicle survivors continue as exact stationary crew-only
  roots without vehicle resurrection, and bubble ownership considers separated
  living/recoverable roots. Frozen-carrier cargo remains at that terminal
  carrier's durable ground position rather than changing vehicle slots.
  Crew elimination leaves a recovery-dependent mission open in an on-station
  hold so unresolved cargo, captives, or vehicles can virtualize and
  rematerialize until their mission-specific outcome is resolved, including a
  cargo-only terminal-carrier root when no intact vehicle remains.
  Historical restored convoys remain contract version `0`; off-screen convoy
  combat and generalized vehicle/asset realization remain open.
- Newly issued policy-v2 purchased resistance garrisons are the fifth explicit
  version-1 operation type after the schema-53 exact enemy patrol. One
  `NotSpawned` empty execution root, arbitrary ordered purchased member roster,
  accepted quote/manifest/garrison backlinks, held batch, local generated route,
  and active group remain one authority graph. The patrol loops indefinitely
  while virtual, materializes only living slots near players, and folds exact
  survivors/cursor state. Owner change, all-dead, campaign stop, setup, or typed
  spawn/route failure settles once with zero refund. Historical policy-v1,
  initial-map, enemy aggregate,
  vehicle, and multi-root garrisons remain legacy; malformed current rows use
  version `-54` quarantine without legacy conversion.
- Newly started `assassinate_officer` guard infantry is the sixth explicit
  version-1 operation type. One zero-cost empty execution root and its exact
  catalog members own a route-less guard assignment offset from—but never
  linked as owner of—the HVT. Guard casualties survive fold/re-entry; all guards
  dead settles only the guard as `DESTROYED` while the HVT objective remains
  active. Mission, owner-change, and coherent spawn/assignment outcomes map to
  typed zero-refund settlement. Historical officer missions, other assassination
  variants, and every remaining mission family remain contract `0`; pre-55
  migration invents nothing. Malformed current rows use version `-55` quarantine
  without fallback or HVT failure. The existing HVT marker/UI row reports guard
  strength. The stamped Schema-55 tree passes foundation, clean Workbench Game
  validation at 5,763 files/11,570 classes with CRC `0ec8950e`, and a ten-sample/
  20-second normal WorldEditor open. Native projection/casualties, save/restart,
  rendered UI, owner-change, campaign-setup, packaged networking, reconnect, and
  JIP proof remain open.
- Newly started `assassinate_traitor` guard infantry is the seventh explicit
  operation-family consumer and reuses the mission-guard operation type at
  contract `2`. Its policy is `exact_assassinate_traitor_guard_v1`; malformed
  current authority uses `-56`. The Schema-55 officer path stays contract `1`/
  `-55`. The traitor path has the same route-less empty-root/member roster,
  separate HVT, survivor-only materialization/fold, HVT-independent all-dead
  result, typed zero-refund settlement, compact restore, and existing-HVT status
  projection. Historical/pre-56 traitor missions, `assassinate_specops`, and all
  other unsupported families remain contract `0`. Migration and conflict events
  are `migration_schema56_exact_traitor_guard` and
  `normalization_schema56_exact_traitor_guard_conflict`. Six source-proof
  categories cover the boundary; native entities/adapter casualties, actual
  save/restart, rendered UI, owner-change, setup, packaged networking, reconnect,
  and JIP are unclaimed. The stamped Schema-56 tree identifies implementation
  `bab5748d817ba434dae701cfbb3b92805d463678` / label
  `schema56-exact-traitor-guard` / stamp
  `03a65cd33bee69c6320389803cdd5a2ec8576fb0`, passes foundation, and passes Workbench Game
  validation at 5,764 files/11,573 classes with CRC `a18c67a5` and
  `Script validation successful`. Its bounded hidden normal WorldEditor open
  stayed alive for ten samples over 20 seconds; the latest log had no script-
  error/crash signature. This is not packaged behavior proof.
- Newly started `assassinate_specops` guard infantry is the eighth explicit
  operation-family consumer and reuses the mission-guard type at contract `3`,
  policy `exact_assassinate_specops_guard_v1`, intent
  `assassinate_specops_guard`, and quarantine `-57`. Officer `1`/`-55` and
  traitor `2`/`-56` remain exact. The spec-ops path reuses the route-less empty-
  root/member roster, separate HVT authority, survivor-only materialize/fold/
  re-entry, no virtual guard combat, typed zero-refund settlement, compact
  restore, and existing-HVT status. Historical/pre-57 spec-ops, ordinary
  `mission_group_*` rows, rescue missions, and unsupported families remain
  contract `0`. Migration/conflict events are
  `migration_schema57_exact_specops_guard` and
  `normalization_schema57_exact_specops_guard_conflict`. Six source-proof
  categories cover the boundary. Schema 57 is stamped at implementation
  `514ebdcbeb1ddfb2a383b19590382517113e2ff6` with build label
  `schema57-exact-specops-guard`. The full foundation gate passes, including
  Schema-55/56/57. Stamped Workbench Game validation loaded 5,765 files/11,576
  classes with CRC `e0b8578e` and `Script validation successful`; the bounded
  hidden normal WorldEditor open stayed alive for 10/10 samples over 20 seconds,
  and its log had no script-error/crash signature. All packaged/native/restart/
  UI/network gates remain open.
- Newly started `rescue_pows` is the ninth exact family consumer and introduces
  `HST_OPERATION_TYPE_MISSION_RESCUE` as the seventh operation type. Schema-58
  contract `1`, policy
  `exact_rescue_pows_v1`, intent `rescue_pows_guard`, and quarantine `-58` own
  one guard roster plus exactly three typed captive slots. HELD/FREED captives
  fold outside the bubble; FOLLOWING/BOARDING/BOARDED retain stable escort/
  vehicle/seat evidence and stay projected. There is no virtual casualty or
  guard-combat inference. Guard elimination does not settle rescue; any captive
  casualty receipt fails, while three HQ extraction receipts succeed through
  normal mission outcomes. A 300-second grace is custody-only and forbids new
  claims. Historical POWs and `rescue_refugees` remain contract `0`. Migration/
  conflict events are `migration_schema58_exact_rescue_pows` and
  `normalization_schema58_exact_rescue_pows_conflict`. Source proof does not
  claim packaged native entities, vehicle seats, restart, rendered UI, owner
  change, setup, networking, reconnect, or JIP. Schema 58 is the preceding
  stamped source/Workbench baseline at implementation
  `f0ba07ff2bc295d12542a3ea34b4c913e99b1869` with build label
  `schema58-exact-rescue-pows`. The full foundation gate passes. Final stamped-
  tree Workbench Game validation loaded 5,770 files/11,594 classes with CRC
  `aa73883a` and `Script validation successful`; the bounded hidden normal
  WorldEditor open stayed responsive for 10/10 samples over 20 seconds with zero
  crash/error matches.
- Schema 59 adds one contract-1 durable radio site per configured radio zone and
  quarantine `-59` for contradictory current authority. One stable site/zone/
  target identity owns ONLINE, DESTROYED, and REBUILDING state, the active exact
  destroy-or-stop-rebuild mission lock, deterministic typed transitions,
  revisions, and destruction/rebuild receipts. Immutable authored prefab/
  position provenance remains distinct from the mutable current projection, and
  each admitted mission snapshots ownership/provenance. The site target identity
  remains stable while each exact mission gets a unique physical runtime-entity
  ID. A supported retained multiphase-damage transmitter is borrowed only when
  uniquely discoverable and is never deleted; an unresolved initial site
  receives no generated fallback. Destroy success requires exact physical target
  evidence and disables radio influence. Stop-rebuild targets construction
  equipment once per tower-destruction epoch; success keeps the site destroyed
  and does not advance that epoch, while failure, expiry, or campaign stop
  creates one campaign-owned ONLINE replacement. Bounded durable evidence-key
  dedupe, checked physical writes, explicit borrowed projection-pending state,
  and destruction-plus-rebuild restore provenance fail closed. Generic mission
  runtime, zone composition, objective ticks, commander progress, and generic
  failure settlement cannot create, delete, or mutate the exact authority. Six
  production-transition source-proof categories cover the state boundary
  through projection-only seams. Native discovery, natural explosives, damage
  reapplication, generated replacement, stream re-entry, actual save/restart,
  rendered UI, setup, packaged networking, reconnect, and JIP remain open.
  The stamped Schema-59 source/Workbench checkpoint identifies implementation
  `37fb5f0ffbc80c4bba3151ba1e5d8be6ffcf8a21` with build label
  `schema59-radio-site-lifecycle`. The full Foundation gate passes; Workbench
  loaded 5,773 files/11,608 classes with CRC `96914c26` and reported
  `Script validation successful`. The bounded normal open stayed alive/
  responding for 10/10 samples over 20 seconds with no script-compile/crash
  signature; one Steamworks stats-request error was nonfatal.
- Schema 60 is the preceding stamped source/Workbench checkpoint under
  implementation `fdf78493dd15915afe8d53f61a8ad1efd65b5635`, UTC
  `2026-07-11T23:24:55Z`, and label `schema60-exact-search-destroy`; Schema 59
  is the preceding checkpoint. Full Foundation passes with 644 symbol references;
  final Workbench Game validation loaded 5,777 files/11,615 classes with CRC
  `7aa80fc9` and created the game; and the correctly targeted hidden normal
  WorldEditor stayed alive/responding 10/10 samples over 20 seconds without a
  first-party error/crash signature. Only newly quoted and confirmed player Search-and-Destroy becomes
  the tenth exact family consumer and eighth operation type. One infantry-only
  catalog roster is frozen at $350 plus one HR per member and linked through
  quote, paired ledger, request, operation, held batch, and active group. It
  continues direct-route travel off-screen, materializes/folds exact survivors,
  applies deterministic abstract-garrison combat, returns virtually to its
  immutable assignment after a displaced fold, and remains on station after
  hostile clear until commander recall. Fold, physical recall exit, and
  campaign-stop retirement exhaustively reconcile the affected projection and,
  while survivors remain, require exact root/member adapter and PhysicalWar
  cardinality. Persistence repeats an exhaustive global reconcile, validates
  reciprocal exact-support ownership, and refreshes the live physical position
  before capture. Held-batch cancellation snapshots strategic living strength
  before cleanup. Pre-60 requests stay contract `0`;
  malformed current claimants quarantine at `-60` without legacy fallback or
  guessed balances, and their groups are globally non-operational/non-combat-
  present. Expired exact-support capacity removes only a replay-valid, unique,
  backlink-free tombstone/terminal-request pair with reciprocal receipts;
  corrupt/quarantined pairs remain. The compiled/wired proof covers valid pair
  prune/restore and corrupt retention but has not run. Diff check is clean apart
  from line-ending warnings. Packaged movement/combat, actual restart, rendered
  UI, stutter/horn, networking, reconnect, and JIP evidence remains open.
- Schema 61 is the sealed marker-only authoritative client-projection boundary
  beneath Schema 62. Logical campaign markers retain stable IDs, per-record revisions,
  last stream sequences, and deletion tombstones under one persisted epoch and
  global watermark. The server publishes bounded hashed snapshot chunks or
  retained contiguous deltas through ownership-derived player sessions, and the
  client atomically maintains a widget-independent registry before reconciling
  client-local native campaign markers. One in-flight batch, final-only ACK,
  post-ACK catch-up, readiness heartbeat, and per-dispatch restart age cover
  rapid mutation, incomplete delivery, and lost ACK without overlapping a fresh
  stream. Builders and decoders share hard payload bounds. Duplicate replay is
  idempotent; gaps,
  invalid revisions, epoch/hash mismatch, malformed packets, reconnect, late
  join, or unavailable journal history converge through resync/full snapshot.
  Server-native campaign marker publication is retired, while dynamic player
  markers remain on their existing replicated-entity path. Native capping uses
  deterministic priority/stable-ID ordering. Authored stock descriptors
  hide only behind a confirmed live custom replacement and restore on failure.
  Pre-61 derived rows rebuild without inventing domain facts, and malformed
  current projection advances the epoch. Compiled deterministic source fixtures
  define ordering, rapid/snapshot-pending catch-up, lost-ACK recovery, resync,
  epoch reset, reconnect/JIP shape, ACK pruning, malformed/oversize input, and
  migration, but packaged
  host/two-client equality, rendered native cleanup, map close/reopen, and real
  save/restart remain open, and the fixtures have not run in Campaign Debug.
  Schema 61 is the preceding sealed marker-projection foundation at implementation
  `27672e67ce4285810f313130293df1ac917c9bdf`, UTC `2026-07-12T01:02:39Z`, and
  label `schema61-authoritative-marker-projection`. Full Foundation passes with
  655 symbol references; final Workbench Game validation loaded 5,782 files/
  11,631 classes with CRC `df41a779` and created the game; hidden normal
  WorldEditor stayed responsive 10/10 over 20 seconds without a first-party
  error/crash signature.
- Schema 62 is an earlier sealed canonical ownership-transition source/
  Workbench boundary.
  Locations carry ownership contract version `1`, monotonic revisions, and
  active/latest receipt backlinks. Military capture, mission capture, political
  support, admin, debug seed, and migration repair all enter one immutable
  expected-owner/revision request. Supported zone aliases resolve to the
  canonical durable ID before fingerprint/replay, and admission stops before an
  unsafe revision boundary. Its durable checklist retires old exact patrol
  and aggregate security plus hostile runtime, creates or retains new-owner
  security, applies frozen support, advances owner/revision once, derives town
  and generated-site/facility/logistics policy, applies frozen retaliation,
  recalculates economy/outcome, completes events, correlates projection, queues
  notification, and schedules persistence. Retry-capable steps precede owner
  publication; coherent incomplete receipts resume from save. Exact replay is a
  no-op, while fingerprint conflict, stale preconditions, unsupported exact
  security, and same-zone concurrent authority fail closed. Accepted exact patrol manifests
  require one reciprocal open, non-quarantined operation and are revalidated on
  every pre-owner retry, including authority introduced after admission.
  Cause policy remains explicit: military/mission captures keep normal enemy
  consequences; admin reconciles security and notifies without retaliation;
  debug seed also suppresses notification; and migration repair preserves
  security while suppressing retaliation/notification. Admission and current-
  schema normalization enforce these cause flags.
  Capture-triggered political child flips complete domain state but delegate
  marker/menu/GM/notification publication to their parent. Later valid top-level
  requests are admitted as pristine accepted/needs-retry receipts and execute in
  array order before any domain mutation. Exact mission, political, admin, and
  migration intent therefore survives the fence and restart. An earlier exact
  linked-town support fact still commits once when a later pristine town receipt
  owns the backlink; only political threshold reconciliation waits for FIFO drain
  and the periodic civilian pass. Queued followers remain valid only while every
  later unresolved top-level receipt is pristine, not merely pre-owner. Ordinary
  rebuilds ignore queued pre-owner receipts, while active owner-applied and completed
  unreleased receipts retain their prior owner/revision; command UI ownership
  is resolver-first and retained markers only corroborate exact owner/source
  revision. Unsafe retained rows quarantine and purge. Only the active owner-
  applied parent can stage publication: it snapshots the full logical marker
  array plus epoch/sequence, validates/releases the exact child receipt-zone-
  marker graph, then commits. Any failure restores the complete snapshot. Setup
  freezes immutable `m_bSetupProjectionWithoutMarkers` receipt history that
  survives active rebuild. The deterministic proof shares production's logical
  snapshot builder and covers
  staged rollback, resolver fail-close/purge, setup history, two-child atomic
  release, and two restart boundaries with exactly-once political completion. A
  five-second civilian sweep admits at most one otherwise-
  unrepresented durable threshold after existing queued work. Restore accepts
  serialized queues only while every later unresolved follower is pristine, and
  quarantines multiple owner-applied publishers or an
  owner-applied publisher behind earlier unresolved top-level authority, and
  iterates parent-quarantine propagation to remove save-row-order
  dependence. It also rejects projection lifecycle/child-chain mismatch and
  duplicate completed zone/revision claims. Support targets must equal the exact
  sorted deterministic set of linked towns plus every town within 1,500 m;
  applied targets are its ordered prefix and each owns
  the same single exact influence row/deltas. Counterattack/order, garrison,
  bounded reason, strategic/campaign event, marker, and setup-mode correlations
  also fail closed. Marker protocol `2`
  carries zone source revision separately from marker-local revision/sequence.
  History is capped at 512 rows with at least 86,400 campaign seconds of replay
  retention and pins for latest, incomplete, quarantined, unreleased-child, and
  unresolved-order authority. Ownership retry runs during setup and terminal
  phases despite the frozen campaign clock. Admin capture/progress reports
  distinguish accepted-pending from rejected, and retry preserves any concrete
  quarantine reason instead of overwriting it with generic resume text. If
  resolver authority is unavailable, projection is unavailable rather than a
  prior/raw-owner leak. Rebuilt explicit-ID commands
  reuse frozen preconditions only after semantic identity matches. Maintenance
  runs ownership retry and then town policy before setup/terminal returns, with a
  frozen-clock bypass; frozen-phase political repair suppresses new retaliation
  and notifications. Ownership strategic events record exact owner/capture/
  aggression facts and exclude unrelated queued/retry global deltas. Pre-62 migration preserves all
  owners/facts as revision-1 baselines without replay; invalid-owner repair first
  reconciles restored receipts, then scans sequentially every five seconds,
  deferring accepted/transient work and quarantining only structural/manual-
  repair cases. Malformed current graphs quarantine at
  `-62`. Foundation passes with 670 script-symbol references, and headless
  Workbench validation is clean at 5,785 files/11,652 classes with CRC
  `22c13a32` and zero script errors; the normal Script Editor open remained
  responsive without a crash. Proof execution, packaged security/save-restart,
  rendering, multiplayer, reconnect, and JIP evidence remains open.
  Major-change marks are edge-triggered/coalesced behind one bounded checkpoint
  deadline; repeated gameplay/retry heartbeats cannot reset it, and the first
  change after a successful checkpoint starts the next interval. Transition
  completion re-arms process-local pending state after final status/backlink
  mutation without extending an existing deadline.
- The Schema-62 liberated-location policy retires enemy town police/roadblocks
  and creates at most two aggregate resistance infantry where capacity exists,
  with no automatic vehicle. Enemy recapture scales infantry from capacity and
  priority and adds vehicles at major military sites; existing exact new-owner
  garrison authority is retained. This is source policy, not packaged balance or
  native population proof.
- The Schema-60 checkpoint represents Maiden's Bay once as the Logistics Warehouse.
  Restore cleanup is no-op when neither location row exists and fails closed
  before rewrites when location authority is ambiguous. With one authority it
  preserves canonical warehouse ownership/economy, removes the duplicate
  town's civilian/influence/marker and ordinary aggregate-garrison state without
  fold-back credit, canonicalizes mutable generic references, and leaves every
  nonzero typed claimant frozen, including settled/quarantined/malformed and
  graphless exact rows. Mutable generated content rekeys; frozen typed sites and
  routes receive deep canonical clones. Ordinary lookup resolves the warehouse,
  while detached historical lookup plus runtime old/canonical equivalence keeps
  frozen assignments usable. The in-memory proof is compiled and wired to
  Campaign Debug but has not run; a pre-update-save packaged restart test remains
  open.
- The one-second runtime hot path now keeps pure-vehicle counts vehicle-only,
  removes redundant/no-convoy whole-group survivor scans, uses registered player
  authority for recurring enforcement, amortizes unresolved radio-site discovery,
  and defers expensive visual evidence until a throttled log actually emits.
  The native wheeled-vehicle base also disables AI horn timing/output while the
  scoped ambient-driver input clear remains. The next server run must prove the
  observed once-per-second stutter and continuous horn behavior are gone.
- Typed support-recall completion across service, coordinator, visible-command
  dispatch, durable receipt, and diagnostics. Accepted terminal wording cannot
  be reclassified by presentation text; exact paired full refunds prevalidate
  both ledger legs before either changes. Other visible commands still retain
  the compatibility text classifier.
- Exact visible garrison recruitment quotes, exact player-paid infantry-QRF
  quotes, and the stamped Schema-60 Search-and-Destroy source quote.
  A new policy-v2 garrison confirmation submits its accepted empty-root/
  member manifest unchanged to held exact patrol authority; historical policy-v1
  purchase provenance remains nondeployable. Paid QRF and Search-and-Destroy
  share the exact infantry adapter while retaining separate operation types and
  policy/settlement identity. Vehicle/asset/multi-root realization and remaining
  paid supports are not yet migrated.
- Everon alpha anchors for strategic zones, towns, hideouts, routes, and
  mission sites
- Physical-war activation scaffold that marks nearby zones active, moves
  abstract garrison counts into route-aware active groups, and folds survivor
  counts back on deactivation
- Sealed Schema-63 activation hysteresis: inactive zones enter at the
  activation radius, while active zones do not fold until every living player
  crosses the larger deactivation radius. Projection state and persisted combat
  heat remain separate authorities; native boundary behavior and stutter impact
  are not yet runtime-proven.
- Source-only HQ policy split: 900m protects hostile operation staging, whole-
  location activation uses the location capture footprint with a 150m fallback,
  and static composition clearance uses 150m. Nearby towns/bases are no longer
  erased wholesale by the staging radius; packaged proof remains open.
- Personnel-authoritative lifecycle for non-queue-managed mixed groups: an
  intact attached vehicle cannot keep a previously populated zero-infantry QRF
  combat-effective. The terminal transition clears capture/marker pressure,
  fails an incomplete linked QRF, preserves the intact vehicle as neutral
  salvage, retains any prior durable field/cargo record, treats unadopted
  salvage as session-only, and remains zero-survivor across schema-48 roundtrip.
- Coordinator dev actions for zone capture, income ticks, mission
  success/failure, training, recruitment, and garrison fold-back
- Dedicated Petros character prefab that inherits from FIA rifleman but can be
  edited independently from player spawn characters; runtime spawning uses the
  GUID-indexed custom prefab first and falls back to the base FIA prefab only
  if needed
- HQ arsenal supply-cache prefab with contextual actions for opening the
  Arsenal/Loot tab, opening the custom loadout editor, and depositing nearby
  loot into campaign arsenal state; inherited stock arsenal actions are
  filtered from the h-istasi HQ arsenal surface
- Procedural h-istasi HQ menu with resource stats, overview, HQ/Petros,
  mission board, map/war, forces, arsenal/loot, garage/build, member, admin,
  action, and activity/result panels
- Broad-alpha persistent state for generated sites/routes, mission objectives,
  campaign tasks, support requests, enemy orders, civilian town state, player
  undercover state, HQ threat/Defend Petros, and strategic campaign-end fields
- Schema 7 zone metadata for display names, resource kinds, capture radii,
  priority, composition IDs, spawn profiles, and linked-zone hints
- Everon 4x-style alpha campaign graph expansion with additional outposts,
  factories, resource depots, seaports, radio towers, banks, and police nodes,
  authored as h-istasi-owned config/anchors/marker stubs
- Generated Everon content service that creates alpha mission sites,
  roadblock/support/stash/crashsite points, and simple route records from the
  existing strategic zone anchors
- Mission objective/task service that attaches rough objectives to started
  missions and lets the no-admin commander flow progress them into normal
  mission completion rewards and strategic outcomes
- Mission runtime service that maps all 39 configured registry IDs into physical MVP
  primitives: kill HVT, hold/clear area, destroy target, recover cargo,
  rescue/extract, deliver supplies, and convoy intercept. This establishes
  configured breadth, not behavioral parity or runtime certification for every
  mission family.
- Stateful support request service with queued deployment pacing:
  FIA/enemy support has ETA/status/cooldown reporting, physical ground-group
  activation when players are nearby, and abstract resolution when off-screen or
  unsupported by base-game assets. Spawned support now retains its live member
  centroid, treats ETA as an earliest observation only, requires two live
  samples from distinct elapsed seconds within 75m for arrival/recall exit, and
  uses transactional direct target/exit waypoint chains with at most three
  consecutive reissues until an 8m new-best distance improvement resets the
  stall budget. Pre-repair restored arrival/exit rows receive one current live-
  distance revalidation. This
  source boundary still needs fresh packaged runtime proof.
- Exact paid player infantry QRF remains the first support consumer on the
  schema-50 strategic projection path. Schema 60 reuses that projection boundary
  only for newly confirmed player Search-and-Destroy while assigning a separate
  operation type, quote policy, $350 cost, and recall/settlement identity. Both
  preserve frozen slots through virtual travel, physical projection, fold, and
  bounded on-station virtual combat; Search-and-Destroy additionally returns to
  its immutable assignment after a displaced fold and waits for commander recall
  after hostile clear. Supply, roadblock, fire, air support, historical Search-
  and-Destroy, legacy/enemy QRF, vehicles, convoys, garrisons, missions, and
  enemy orders are not migrated by this player-support cutover.
- Enemy commander service with patrol/QRF/search, counterattack, rebuild,
  support-call, and Petros attack orders that track physicalized or abstract
  runtime state and outcome application. Schema 51 routes only newly planned
  infantry-only defensive QRFs through exact operation authority, suppressing a
  parallel legacy response at the same target and bypassing the fixed legacy
  resolution timer. Schema 53 routes only newly queued patrols through a separate
  type-plus-version exact owner with one proactive debit, one frozen infantry
  root, generated-route loop/return, contact hold, fold/reprojection, and exact
  survivor settlement. Historical patrols remain legacy.
- Newly purchased policy-v2 resistance garrisons use a separate exact
  `GARRISON_PATROL` owner. They walk a persisted infinite local route while held,
  use survivor-only materialization/fold, publish one exact marker/UI count, and
  never enter the legacy aggregate PhysicalWar activation/fold path. This does
  not migrate initial/enemy aggregate or vehicle garrisons.
- Civilian/undercover service with reputation, wanted heat, police and roadblock
  presence/scans, aid effects, undercover eligibility, request/application,
  enforcement, compromise, and clear-state records. Sealed Schema 64 moves
  political support/population out of those compatibility rows into the sole
  canonical `HST_TownInfluenceRecord`; undercover and reports resolve the
  canonical signed support projection.
  Current source separates true town centers from minor localities, decouples
  nearby civilian projection from HQ-suppressed hostile activation, selects
  distinct concrete appearances, and gives true towns a configurable daytime/
  low-heat traffic target (default five) when population and global budgets permit. The known
  woodland locality remains limited to two pedestrians. Scoped ambient driver
  horn clearing and the Schema-60 native wheeled-base override remain in place.
  Sealed Settings-24 source additionally supplies leased fair allocation, bounded
  scheduling/readiness/recovery, owner-aware static refresh, and transient-
  vehicle save filtering. Republished behavior, real restart, and soak proof
  remain open.
- Command menu actions for setup hideout selection, dynamic mission targets,
  mission runtime and persistence inspection, HQ threat/Defend Petros reports,
  FIA support requests/cancel, support/enemy-order reports, civilian aid,
  undercover eligibility/request/check/clear, arsenal withdrawal, vehicle-cargo
  collection/unload, nearby vehicle garage capture, build-mode garage redeploy,
  HQ runtime-asset rebuild, marker audits, balance/pacing reports,
  campaign-end reports, command coverage checks, simple roster admin, and
  campaign reset
- Economy and enemy resource income now account for resource kind, priority,
  factories, ports, airfields, depots, radio towers, and police nodes
- Area and vehicle loot services with eligible-item scanning, base-game
  resource validation, blocked/finite-only/unlock policy checks, source item
  removal, HQ-object protection, and vehicle cargo reports
- Virtual garage scaffolding for safe root-vehicle capture, physical and
  virtual cargo preservation, verified despawn before record storage, dry-ground
  redeploy placement, runtime vehicle registration, and nearby field-vehicle
  snapshot/restore during checkpoint/restore flow
- Custom loadout editor path with server-authoritative HQ radius/member checks,
  live equipment and storage nodes, compatible candidate lists, five fixed
  personal save slots, `$profile:h-istasi/loadouts/v2` persistence, finite/INF
  cost ledgers, atomic apply/rollback, issued-item tracking, death-loss
  accounting, and removed external item purging
- Mission-specific convoy outcome state for delivered cargo/captives, captured
  vehicles, armored convoy garage handoff, ammo convoy ammo points, and outcome
  de-dupe across reloads
- Marker/UI polish with marker status/detail/audit reports, native marker
  publish diagnostics, command/report coverage audits, menu summaries, and
  clear failed-action text. Current source validates and dynamically resolves
  the radio icon instead of assuming an array index, includes location and owner
  in zone labels, keeps the map pointer above target-confirmation dialogs, and
  reuses authored radio transmitters for compositions and destroy targets.
  Schema 61 additionally streams logical campaign markers through a revisioned,
  tombstoned client registry and makes that registry the sole owner of local
  native campaign marker reconciliation. Exact authored static-marker names are
  cached instead of radius-polled. These repairs await packaged proof.
- Balance/pacing diagnostics for strategic score, control percentage, war-level
  thresholds, enemy pressure, victory readiness, and recommended next pressure
- Strategic victory/loss evaluation with persistent campaign-end reason,
  summary, elapsed time, control percent, war level, FIA/enemy zone counts, and
  campaign-end report generation state

## Current Verification Boundary

- The current sealed source/Workbench checkpoint keeps Campaign Schema 64 and
  advances runtime-settings Schema 24 under implementation
  `6afadc7c13681b78171939a740862e52328beffd`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T15:57:55Z`, and label
  `schema64-settings24-ambient-runtime-authority`. Final sealed-tree evidence is
  Foundation at 711 script-symbol references plus normal and all-five-
  configuration Workbench checks at 5,799 files/11,718 classes with CRC
  `bb083672`, explicit validation success,
  zero HST script errors, and zero surviving Workbench processes. Deterministic
  proofs remain unexecuted in Campaign Debug, and no native, packaged, restart,
  rendered-UI, multiplayer, or certification claim follows from this evidence.
- Schema 62 is an earlier sealed source/Workbench checkpoint at implementation
  `7c93e0a485bcabe5a364c0b0cfeca235accb50f7`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T06:11:19Z`, and label
  `schema62-canonical-ownership-transition`. Foundation passes with 670 script-
  symbol references. Headless Workbench Game validation completed cleanly at
  5,785 files/11,652 classes with CRC `22c13a32` and zero script errors. The
  normal Script Editor open remained responsive without a crash, and zero
  Workbench processes survived. No Schema-62
  Campaign Debug, packaged owner-change, native security, actual restart,
  rendered marker, multiplayer, reconnect, or JIP evidence exists yet.
- Schema 61 is the preceding sealed marker-projection foundation
  under label `schema61-authoritative-marker-projection`, with implementation
  `27672e67ce4285810f313130293df1ac917c9bdf` and UTC
  `2026-07-12T01:02:39Z`, Foundation 655, and final Workbench CRC `df41a779` at
  5,782 files/11,631 classes. Schema 60 is the preceding checkpoint. The Maiden's Bay
  migration fixture has compiled and is wired as
  `location_taxonomy.maidens_bay_schema60`, but Campaign Debug has not executed
  that assertion; the Search-and-Destroy proof and typed-QRF mismatch assertion
  are also compiled/wired but unexecuted. No packaged restore/restart, rendered
  UI, stutter/horn, or live behavior evidence exists. Schema-61 source fixtures
  are not host/client/reconnect/JIP runtime evidence, and its protocol-2 source-
  revision extension remains a Schema-62 gate.
- A published schema-49 server/client check verified that normal stock HUD, Game
  Master access, map publication, and civilian traffic initialize again. This
  closes the earlier missing-config-metadata regression. The late-admin recursive
  role-change guard still needs a clean packaged check.
- The same run exposed eighteen invalid radio markers as giant colored boxes,
  location markers without names, and a map pointer rendered beneath the support
  confirmation dialog. It also showed a generated tower next to an existing
  transmitter. The marker-table, label, z-order, composition, and mission-target
  corrections exist only in current source and must be republished before they
  count as fixed.
- Civilian vehicles moved in that run, but town actors repeated one appearance,
  drivers held the horn, Figari and Morton projected no civilians because HQ
  safety cleared their shared military-active bit, and the known woodland
  locality projected full town ambience. Current source separates civilian
  eligibility, uses concrete variants, gives true towns a configurable budget-
  limited daytime/low-heat traffic target (default five), limits the minor
  locality to two pedestrians, clears ambient horn input, and applies the
  wheeled-base horn override. The sealed source/Workbench Settings-24 allocator/lifecycle work
  supersedes the old
  unconditional projection policy, but those outcomes are not yet runtime-
  proven.
- A later user server check reported a pronounced once-per-second stutter,
  continuous AI horns, and overlapping Maiden's Bay town/Logistics Warehouse
  locations. Source now removes the known per-second reconciliation/query/
  authority/evidence multipliers, suppresses base wheeled AI horn behavior, and
  retires the duplicate town with conservative save cleanup. The next published
  run must measure the cadence and visually/audibly confirm all three results.
- The schema-50 player exact-QRF strategic movement/materialization/virtual-
  combat path has deterministic fixtures and persistence coverage in source.
  The packaged schema-49 check did not accept an exact paid QRF, so it provides
  no operation, movement, fold, virtual-combat, or restart evidence for this
  slice. Schema 51 adds deterministic fixtures for exact enemy defensive-QRF
  admission, legacy isolation, projection, return/settlement, restore, and
  rejection, but none has executed in a packaged runtime. The stamped Schema-56
  tree identifies implementation `bab5748d817ba434dae701cfbb3b92805d463678`
  / label `schema56-exact-traitor-guard` / stamp
  `03a65cd33bee69c6320389803cdd5a2ec8576fb0`; foundation passes, Workbench Game
  validation loaded 5,764 files/11,573 classes with CRC `a18c67a5` and
  `Script validation successful`, and its bounded hidden normal WorldEditor open
  stayed alive for ten samples over 20 seconds without a latest-log script-error/
  crash signature. This is source/Workbench evidence, not packaged behavior proof.
- Schema 52 adds the exact mission-convoy aggregate in source. No packaged run has yet proved its
  three physical vehicles/crews, virtual route movement, materialization/fold,
  exact casualty persistence, arrival/outcome settlement, marker cleanup, or
  real process restart. The latest packaged convoy artifact predates this
  contract and therefore cannot certify it.
  Nine deterministic `mission_convoy.*` assertions cover admission and
  rollback, projection/fold gating, casualty-stable restore, settlement,
  open/settled/recovery restore, aggregate-marker cleanup, and the
  materialization watchdog. Admission/corruption subfixtures reject invalid
  cargo, foreign authority, invalid seat topology, forged arrival receipts,
  illegal lifecycle pairs, and non-member casualty roots while preserving
  missionless exact-looking durable claimants; they are not
  engine-backed proof.
- Schema 53 adds the exact enemy-patrol aggregate in source. No packaged run has
  proved proactive debit/refund, virtual outbound travel, physical
  materialization/fold, mapped casualty persistence, contact hold, one closed
  route lap, return, marker cleanup, or real process restart. Ten deterministic
  `enemy_patrol.*` assertions cover admission, collision-safe replay/refund,
  route loop, queue/roster bookkeeping, contact transition, settlement,
  physical-shaped restore, corruption, dispatch/priority isolation, and marker
  lifecycle. Production source additionally requires an exact root/member/
  PhysicalWar binding graph before movement, fold, save, or settlement; deleted
  bindings without observed death remain unresolved. Historical patrol rows remain contract
  version `0`; malformed current rows retain quarantine version `-53` without
  cross-owner fallback, guessed refund, or save while runtime ownership remains.
  These are source fixtures rather than engine-backed proof.
- Schema 54 adds the exact purchased-garrison patrol aggregate in source. Only a
  newly issued policy-v2 resistance purchase opts in; policy-v1 history and
  initial/enemy aggregate garrisons remain legacy. Source fixtures cover atomic
  admission, arbitrary members beneath an empty root, virtual infinite-loop
  cursor, survivor-only reprojection, PhysicalWar isolation, zero-refund owner-
  change/all-dead settlement, missing-live-runtime quarantine, marker/UI
  projection, and conservative `-54` restore quarantine through nine thematic
  `garrison_patrol.*` assertions. Production source also owns campaign-stop,
  setup, and typed route/spawn-failure terminal branches, but those branches do
  not yet have equivalent deterministic fixtures. No packaged run has proved native
  waypoint movement, observed casualties, fold/rematerialization, save/restart,
  client marker rendering, reconnect, or JIP for this slice.
- Schema 55 adds exact guard authority only for a newly started
  `assassinate_officer` mission. Source fixtures cover admission/legacy
  isolation, held-survivor projection, HVT-independent all-dead settlement,
  typed zero-refund outcomes, restore/migration, `-55` quarantine, and existing-
  HVT marker/UI status. Historical officer missions and every other mission
  family remain contract `0`; the HVT is not a manifest member or operation
  asset, and quarantine does not terminate it. No packaged run has proved native
  entity creation, real adapter bindings/casualties, physical fold/re-entry,
  actual save/restart, rendered status, owner-change, campaign setup, networking,
  reconnect, or JIP for this slice.
- Schema 56 adds exact guard authority only for a newly started
  `assassinate_traitor` mission at contract `2` and policy
  `exact_assassinate_traitor_guard_v1`. The six `traitor_guard.*` source-proof
  categories cover admission/family isolation, survivor projection/HVT
  separation, typed settlement, restore/pre-56 migration, `-56` conflict
  quarantine, and existing-HVT status. Officer contract `1` remains exact;
  historical/pre-56 traitor, spec-ops, and all other unsupported missions remain
  contract `0`. No packaged run has proved native entities, adapter casualties,
  actual save/restart, rendered UI, owner-change, setup, networking, reconnect,
  or JIP. The stamped implementation/Workbench evidence is recorded above and
  does not close those behavior gates.
- Schema 57 adds exact guard authority only for a newly started
  `assassinate_specops` mission at contract `3`, policy
  `exact_assassinate_specops_guard_v1`, and intent
  `assassinate_specops_guard`. Officer contract `1`/`-55` and traitor contract
  `2`/`-56` remain exact; historical/pre-57 spec-ops guards, unsupported
  families, and ordinary `mission_group_*` rows remain contract `0` and are not
  claimants. Generic spec-ops composition may propose multiple groups; contract
  `3` deterministically selects the strongest executable group, keeps the stable
  first group on ties, freezes only that selected catalog roster, and grants
  discarded groups no authority. The exact roster stays route-less and HVT-separated, preserves
  survivors/casualties through materialize-fold-re-entry, performs no virtual
  combat, and settles typed outcomes with zero refund. Restore records
  `migration_schema57_exact_specops_guard`; conflicting exact claimants
  quarantine at `-57` with
  `normalization_schema57_exact_specops_guard_conflict`. This source slice is
  stamped at implementation `514ebdcbeb1ddfb2a383b19590382517113e2ff6` under
  build label `schema57-exact-specops-guard`. Packaged/native/save-restart/
  rendered-UI/owner-change/setup/network/reconnect/JIP proof remains open.
- Schema 58 adds exact rescue authority only for a newly started `rescue_pows`.
  Six source categories cover admission/family isolation, composite guard-plus-
  captive authority, replay-safe captive transitions, guard independence,
  casualty/success/grace outcomes, and restore/quarantine. The queue executes
  only group/member slots; the rescue service owns three captive rows. Missing
  entities never imply death, HQ is the only extraction point, and configured
  target-town support uses the normal once-only reward path. This is the
  earlier stamped source/Workbench baseline at implementation
  `f0ba07ff2bc295d12542a3ea34b4c913e99b1869`, label
  `schema58-exact-rescue-pows`. Final stamped-tree Workbench validation loaded
  5,770 files/11,594 classes with CRC `aa73883a` and
  `Script validation successful`; its bounded normal open passed 10/10 samples
  over 20 seconds with zero crash/error matches. Native/packaged/restart/rendered-UI/owner-change/
  setup/network/reconnect/JIP proof remains open.
- Schema 59 moves radio transmitters and both radio mission IDs out of generic
  composition/runtime ownership. The exact lifecycle preserves a borrowed
  authored target, prevents parallel towers, records physical destruction,
  makes influence ONLINE-only, represents an active rebuild with construction
  equipment, and creates a generated replacement only when rebuild settlement
  actually returns the site ONLINE. One rebuild-stop attempt is allowed per
  destruction epoch, equipment destruction does not mint a new epoch, direct
  evidence requires reciprocal lock/component/position/provenance checks plus a
  unique persisted bounded key, and every mission projection has an identity
  distinct from the stable site target. A
  new-campaign reset restores the authored target or fails closed; a permanent
  generated ONLINE projection disables verbose witness logging and keeps its
  nearby-entity scan dormant until exact mission identity exists. Source proofs
  cover admission, every outcome, replay/stale revision, durable evidence,
  repeat-admission rejection, linked restore/migration/quarantine cleanup,
  influence, and ownership handoff through projection-only seams;
  the native and packaged runtime boundary remains open.
- The non-cascade convoy artifact populated all three crew groups 2/2 but
  confirmed zero seated drivers through the full grace window. Current source
  registers each usable vehicle before seating, tries authority-local forced
  entry before the owner-RPC fallback, and probes retained registration
  directly. Current schema-52 source validation passes as described
  above, while 3/3 driver and movement proof remains open.
- Every real persistence capture now reconciles mapped physical exact-convoy,
  exact-patrol, exact-mission-guard, and exact player-support members first.
  Physical exact support must prove one reciprocal request/operation/batch/group
  graph, exact living root/member adapter and PhysicalWar cardinality, and a
  refreshed live position after the exhaustive casualty pass. An open outbound
  publication transaction, materializing exact-infantry handoff, ambiguous or
  aliased mapping, cardinality conflict, or unverifiable live position defers
  capture without flushing stale state or requesting a savepoint, retains intent,
  and retries on the bounded cadence. Real death-between-ticks, deferred-save
  retry, restore, and rematerialization still need packaged proof.
- Normal-play support evidence marked three groups `physical_arrived` while its
  logged targets and deterministic recall-exit vectors imply nominal current
  positions approximately 434m, 455m, and 505m away. Current source removes ETA-only completion, uses the living-member
  centroid, normalizes exact QRF handoff to `support_active`, and bounds direct
  target/exit waypoint reissue. A Phase 22 group populated 9/9 without observed
  advance, but campaign-time-only samples are not physical-stall proof. Fresh
  packaged support movement, arrival, and recall proof remains open.
- The same normal-play artifact independently showed a mixed QRF repeatedly
  reconciling at zero living infantry because its intact empty vehicle supplied
  the aggregate living count, including after the target changed ownership.
  The deterministic lifecycle proof now covers terminal state, capture pressure,
  QRF marker ordering, replay, roundtrip, and vehicle-only controls. Real entity
  detachment, player salvage, replication, and restart still need a disposable
  packaged runtime proof.
- The latest inspected Full Campaign Debug artifact predates schemas 43-60,
  contains a destructive save contamination and a large defense-probe cascade,
  and is not current certification evidence.
- The in-process runner now fails closed outside `HST_Dev`, clones campaign
  state, diverts checkpoints, and restores the original reference. Six known
  false-negative observations are repaired, but neither isolation nor those
  repaired rows have run in a fresh isolated artifact.

## Current Delivery Priorities

- Publish only the exact sealed Campaign Schema-64/runtime-settings Schema-24
  identity `schema64-settings24-ambient-runtime-authority`. Preserve the already
  restored
  stock HUD/Game Master
  behavior. Require every ownership cause, one revision increment, retry-before-
  owner, exact-security settlement, nested publication, save/restart resume,
  protocol-2 source revision, host/client registry identity, plus valid-sized
  icons, location-plus-owner-plus-status
  labels, pointer-over-dialog ordering, exactly one borrowed authored
  transmitter, reciprocal physical destroy evidence with 0.75-meter authored
  identity versus 12-meter safe-ground projection tolerance, offline influence
  suppression, one construction-equipment stop-rebuild attempt per destruction
  epoch, no epoch renewal from stopped equipment, pending-stream recovery,
  linked quarantine cleanup, new-campaign authored-target restoration, and one
  generated replacement only when the rebuild completes.
- In the same isolated runtime boundary, prove Schema-63 registered conscious
  infantry, cargo exclusion, pilot/turret and armed-mobile/static classification,
  destroyed/burning/immobile exclusion, empty-vehicle behavior, virtual survivor
  continuity, every shared consumer, exact 30-second
  `HOT -> COOLING -> COLD`, conservative restore, one-second cache invalidation,
  and activation/deactivation hysteresis. Static fixtures do not close these
  native/save/restart gates.
- Prove Schema-64 one-record town authority, 100/200/50-bp formula goldens,
  strict 8000/4000 equality, occupier/invader separation, typed-event replay,
  ownership-service delegation, pre-64 migration/current `-64` quarantine,
  contact discovery, current-first Zone Pressure, complete deterministic
  Resistance Territory, legacy projection only, due-expiry cost, and real
  save/restart. Static fixtures do not close these gates.
- Run at least ten simultaneously eligible towns for ten minutes and require
  zero unregistered member-state RPCs, distinct appearances, fair leased
  allocation, bounded root transaction starts, and the configurable daytime/low-
  heat traffic target (default five) per true town when population/global budgets
  permit. Keep two pedestrians at the minor woodland locality, no stuck horns,
  Figari/Morton ambience independent of hostile military activation, and static
  military roots correct after owner/policy changes. Maiden's Bay must show only
  the Logistics Warehouse. Prove the per-frame brief enter/exit observation and
  fail-closed barrier on every `HST_PersistenceService` capture/checkpoint path,
  plus new-campaign reset reconciliation, through native autosave/restart,
  promoted-root destruction, teardown/re-entry/recovery/recycle, and freezes-per-
  minute evidence. Include two-nearby-same-prefab restoration with no root
  collapse and exact reset retention/normalization. Campaign Debug Phase 20 must
  demonstrate the same production global plan and four-root transaction-start
  cap rather than an
  isolated one-town allocation. Aid and ownership/security-pressure source paths
  exist but need runtime proof; automatic casualty, theft, nearby-combat
  influence, panic/recovery, and deeper local-security behavior remain open.
- Runtime-prove the Schema-60 player Search-and-Destroy contract: immutable
  infantry-only quote/manifest/ledger identity, $350 plus exact roster HR, direct
  virtual travel, materialization/fold/re-entry with mapped casualties, bounded
  off-screen combat, displaced-fold return to assignment, on-station hold after
  hostile clear, commander recall/living-HR settlement, archive replay, legacy
  contract `0`, `-60` quarantine, safe paired capacity eviction, corrupt-pair
  retention, and real save/restart. Include a live adapter-
  observed casualty, cardinality-checked projection/root retirement, and a
  separate physical recall exit; the synthetic queue casualty/fold fixture does
  not close those packaged-runtime gates.
- Prove campaign-debug isolation through completion, cancellation, interrupted
  recovery, and development-session restart, then replace the historical full
  artifact with corrected evidence.
- Runtime-prove the schema-43 through schema-60 authority chain: exact training,
  garrison, paid-QRF, queue/handoff, strategic travel, materialization/fold
  hysteresis, exact casualty/survivor transfer, bounded virtual combat,
  operation migration, settlement archive replay, typed recall receipt status,
  rejected paired-settlement conflicts, enemy defensive-QRF admission/legacy
  isolation/return/resource settlement, capacity, and save/restart idempotency.
- Runtime-prove the schema-52 exact convoy's frozen route, three vehicle/crew
  elements, vehicle-zero cargo/captive assignment, virtual travel, 3/3 drivers,
  physical interception, contact-to-clear transition, casualty-preserving fold/
  rematerialization, two-sample
  arrival, once-only outcome settlement, aggregate marker cleanup, and restart.
  Then use scoped disposable profiles to prove actual
  support movement, two-sample arrival within 75m, physical recall exit, and
  transactional waypoint reissue within the three-attempt bound. Include the
  crewless mixed-QRF case and require one neutral salvage detach, zero capture/
  marker pressure, no duplicate record, and restart-stable terminal state.
- Runtime-prove the schema-53 exact patrol: one proactive debit, one frozen
  infantry root, outbound virtual travel, physical materialization/fold, mapped
  casualties, contact-held progress, one closed generated-route lap, return,
  survivor refund, marker cleanup, and save/restart. Historical patrols must
  remain contract version `0` and quarantined rows must never enter legacy code.
- Runtime-prove the schema-54 exact purchased-garrison patrol: only new policy-v2
  resistance purchases opt in; exact arbitrary members remain under one empty
  root; virtual local looping, survivor-only physical fold/re-entry, owner-change/
  all-dead/campaign-stop/setup and typed spawn/route-failure zero-refund
  settlement, marker/UI cleanup, save/restart, reconnect, and JIP all preserve one
  roster/cursor. Historical policy-v1,
  initial/enemy aggregate, vehicle, and multi-root garrisons remain legacy.
- Runtime-prove the schema-55 exact officer-mission guard: only newly started
  `assassinate_officer` guards receive one route-less empty-root/member roster.
  Prove native materialization/casualties/fold, all-guards-dead with an active
  HVT, every typed zero-refund outcome, `-55` quarantine without fallback or HVT
  failure, compact settlement, existing-HVT marker/UI status, save/restart,
  owner-change, campaign setup, networking, reconnect, and JIP. Historical
  officer missions remain contract `0`; the separately opted-in traitor path must
  not alter officer contract `1`.
- Runtime-prove the schema-56 exact traitor-mission guard: only newly started
  `assassinate_traitor` guards receive contract `2` and policy
  `exact_assassinate_traitor_guard_v1`. Prove the route-less exact roster, HVT
  separation, survivor materialization/fold, typed zero-refund outcomes, compact
  restore, `-56` quarantine, existing-HVT status, native entities/adapter
  casualties, actual save/restart, rendered UI, owner-change, setup, networking,
  reconnect, and JIP. Officer contract `1` must remain exact; historical/pre-56
  traitor and all other unsupported families must remain contract `0`. The
  Schema-57 spec-ops path must not alter traitor contract `2`.
- Runtime-prove the schema-57 exact spec-ops-mission guard: only newly started
  `assassinate_specops` guards receive contract `3`, policy
  `exact_assassinate_specops_guard_v1`, and intent
  `assassinate_specops_guard`. Prove the route-less exact roster, HVT
  separation, survivor materialization/fold/re-entry, casualty-stable restore,
  typed zero-refund outcomes, compact restore, `-57` conflict quarantine,
  existing-HVT status, and the no-virtual-combat boundary. Then prove native
  entities/adapter casualties, actual save/restart, rendered UI, owner-change,
  setup, networking, reconnect, and JIP. Officer contract `1` and traitor
  contract `2` must remain exact; historical/pre-57 spec-ops guards, ordinary
  `mission_group_*` rows, and unsupported families must remain contract `0`.
- Runtime-prove the schema-58 exact POW rescue: only newly started `rescue_pows`
  may use the ninth explicit family consumer across the seventh operation type.
  Prove the exact guard roster plus three captive identities, live action
  projection, natural boarding/seat evidence, fold/re-entry, casualty failure,
  three-receipt HQ success, custody-only grace, actual save/restart, owner change,
  campaign setup, packaged networking, reconnect, and JIP. Historical POWs,
  `rescue_refugees`, and unsupported rescue families must remain contract `0`.
- Runtime-prove the Schema-59 radio-site lifecycle: unique authored discovery,
  no duplicate projection, natural explosive destruction, offline influence,
  reciprocal lock/component/position/provenance evidence, bounded durable
  evidence-key dedupe, checked physical writes, unique per-mission physical IDs,
  one stop-rebuild equipment attempt per destruction epoch without epoch renewal,
  failure/expiry replacement with dormant unbound witness scanning, authored-target
  restoration on new-campaign reset, damaged-state reapplication, stream re-
  entry, pending borrowed-projection recovery, linked quarantine closure,
  current and migrated save/restart, marker/UI status, setup, packaged
  networking, reconnect, and JIP. Missing or ambiguous initial targets must
  remain unresolved rather than generating a substitute; projection-seam source
  proof is not packaged verification.
- Prove static marker widget readiness and the implemented Schema-61
  authoritative host/client/late-join snapshot, revision, tombstone,
  acknowledgement, gap, and resync behavior. Require equal hashes/watermarks,
  map-close continuity, no duplicate server-native campaign set, and real
  reconnect/save-restart; keep dynamic player markers and non-marker campaign
  projection outside this claim.
- Treat the Schema-62 canonical ownership service as the completed source
  mutation dependency and sealed Schema 63 as the first shared combat-
  presence/heat dependency. Sealed Schema 64 adds the canonical town-
  influence dependency and contacted political-map projection, but does not end
  Blueprint Phase 7. After runtime proof, continue with generalized
  encounter outcomes and broader post-liberation/facility consequences.
- Runtime-prove both exact-QRF `OperationRecord` policies: player virtual combat/
  recall/archive and enemy defensive arrival/return/proportional settlement,
  including physical/virtual transfer, marker cleanup, and restore for both.
  Then connect live physical contact/disengagement and deepen encounter
  simulation without treating source implementation as packaged proof.
- Continue the implementation blueprint with one explicitly versioned mission-
  force consumer at a time. Schema 57 exhausts assassination guards and Schema
  58 implements only the first rescue slice; Schema 59 separately exactifies
  radio-site identity and lifecycle; Schema 60 adds only the player Search-and-
  Destroy force consumer; Schema 61 adds only marker projection; Schema 62 adds
  canonical location ownership without adding a force family; Schema 63 adds
  shared combat presence/heat without adding a force family; sealed Schema
  64 adds canonical town influence and political Map/War projection without a
  force family. Other rescue and unsupported mission/support families remain
  legacy. Packaged schema-50 through schema-64 certification remains
  independently required. The current Campaign Schema-64/runtime-settings
  Schema-24 checkpoint is sealed only at the source/Workbench boundary; native,
  packaged, restart, rendered-UI, multiplayer, and certification gates remain.

## Next Playable Expansion

- Restart/migration testing for `HST_CampaignSaveData` under native Reforger
  save/load, including active support/order/Defend Petros and won/lost saves
- HST_Dev end-to-end smoke and UX polish for the custom loadout editor,
  including live inventory edge cases, death-loss accounting, and save/load
  confidence
- Garage/source-vehicle soak for capture, cargo preservation, redeploy,
  ammo/repair/fuel classification, runtime vehicle restore, and longer restart
  testing
- Mission-family polish that replaces remaining physical MVP shortcuts with
  mission-specific props, richer hold/clear checks, and better objective text
- Richer active-group waypoints/routes for QRFs, support, counterattacks,
  Defend Petros attackers, and survivor fold-back into abstract garrisons
- Tune Phase 24 starting training, war-level thresholds, enemy income scaling,
  aggression decay, victory/loss thresholds, and pacing recommendations through
  repeated runs
- Phase 25 repeated campaign loops and long-soak testing across HST_Dev and
  HST_Everon begin only after the Runtime Integrity evidence above is reliable

## Later Alpha Increments

- Exact full-Everon coordinate survey and replacement of remaining 4x-style
  alpha anchors once a Workbench/PAC extraction path is available
- Authored h-istasi HQ entities for cache/tent polish and customized Petros
  appearance/loadout
- Full player-facing member, guest, commander election, and admin UI polish
- Deeper town, factory, resource, radio tower, police, and city-flip behavior
  beyond the current broad-alpha support/enforcement layer
- Mission-specific world logic and unique content for every registry entry
- Explicit dispositions and implementations for intelligence/reveal,
  interrogation/informants, respawn/revive, fast travel, construction/
  fortifications, radio/intelligence networks, player squads/high command, and
  medical/logistical recovery; dependent actions and missions stay disabled
  when a system is intentionally deferred
- Larger multiplayer and long-duration campaign soak, including 16-player runs

## Deferred Capabilities

The base-game preset must disable mechanics that cannot be honestly
represented with stock Arma Reforger resources. Do not add hidden dependencies
or synthetic replacements.

- Fixed-wing aircraft support
- SEAD support when no suitable radar and SAM asset pair is available
- Any artillery support without a suitable physical base-game asset

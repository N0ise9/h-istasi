# h-istasi Architecture

## Runtime Ownership

`HST_CampaignCoordinatorComponent` is the server-side entry point. It owns a
single `HST_CampaignState` and delegates to small services. The cross-cutting
schema-42 through schema-55 authority services are:

- `HST_StableIdService`: allocates persisted, monotonic IDs for generated
  commands and events, and builds deterministic operation/transaction links.
- `HST_CampaignCommandService`: validates typed command envelopes and keeps a
  bounded persisted receipt history so replaying the same request ID cannot
  apply the same mutation twice. `CompleteExplicit` records an authoritative
  applied/rejected status supplied by a migrated command result; `Complete`
  remains a presentation-text compatibility classifier for unmigrated visible
  commands.
- `HST_ResourceLedgerService`: records reserve, commit, cancel, and refund
  transitions for resource mutations. Troop training, exact garrison
  confirmation, and exact player-QRF confirmation/settlement consume it.
- `HST_CampaignEventLogService`: appends bounded persisted campaign events for
  authority decisions and resource transitions.
- `HST_ForceCatalogService`: owns the versioned exact group templates and
  validates their ordered execution-prefab slots.
- `HST_ForcePlanningService` and `HST_ForcePlanningIntegrityService`: issue and
  reconcile immutable garrison/player-QRF quotes and manifests plus exact enemy
  defensive-QRF manifests, own
  deterministic hashing/catalog validation shared by queue admission, and keep
  accepted confirmation replay idempotent across later settlement.
- `HST_ForceSettlementArchiveService`: compacts only terminal, backlink-free
  accepted planning aggregates into bounded persisted replay tombstones. It owns
  full-row retention, archive capacity, replay reconstruction, and fail-closed
  admission when protected history cannot make room. For canonical exact-QRF
  operations, compaction additionally requires a coherently settled record,
  copies its typed terminal/revision/settlement evidence, and removes the full
  record with the other accepted aggregate rows.
- `HST_OperationService`: owns the version-1 canonical operation transition
  contract for confirmed exact paid player QRFs and newly admitted exact enemy
  defensive-QRF orders, and supplies shared deterministic settlement identity
  to the schema-52 mission-convoy owner. For the QRF consumers it preserves immutable
  origin/assignment separately from the mutable tactical target; validates
  duty, materialization, engagement, return, and settlement transitions; and
  rejects identity or terminal replay conflicts. Schema 50 added strategic-
  route, projection-decision, and virtual-combat authority for the player QRF.
  Schema 51 adds the reciprocal enemy-order contract, two-sample physical
  arrival authority, return-to-origin duty, and typed `COMPLETED` settlement for
  the enemy defensive QRF without opting legacy rows or other order families in.
- `HST_StrategicMovementService`: owns the schema-50 direct-route cursor and
  conservative 2.5 m/s campaign movement shared by the two supported exact
  infantry-QRF consumers. It derives ETA from route distance, advances only
  while strategic position authority is active, and caps catch-up at 30
  campaign seconds per invocation.
- `HST_MaterializationService`: evaluates either supported exact infantry QRF
  against a player-bubble materialize-in distance and a larger materialize-out
  distance. The hysteresis band prevents churn; an engaged physical projection
  cannot fold.
- `HST_VirtualCombatService`: resolves only an on-station exact paid player
  infantry QRF against hostile abstract infantry in its target garrison. It advances in
  deterministic 30-second power steps, processes at most four steps per tick,
  retires exact manifest member slots, and persists fractional damage carries.
- `HST_OperationProjectionProofService`: adds focused movement, hysteresis,
  roster-transfer, and combat/restore assertions beside the existing eight
  operation-record assertions. These are source-level debug fixtures until a
  packaged runtime executes them.
- `HST_EnemyQRFOperationService`: owns schema 51 admission and runtime authority
  for newly planned infantry-only enemy defensive QRFs. It selects a distinct
  same-faction operational source for a same-faction defended target under resistance pressure, links one prepaid
  frozen manifest to one order, operation, held SpawnQueue batch, and active
  group; advances virtual/physical outbound and return legs; applies defensive
  capture-pressure reduction once on arrival; and settles survivor-proportional
  enemy resources once after return. Missing or conflicting authority fails
  closed instead of falling back to the legacy timer/support path.
- `HST_EnemyQRFOperationProofService`: contributes six focused
  `enemy_qrf.*` debug assertions for atomic admission, legacy isolation,
  projection transfer, survivor settlement, current-schema restore, and
  rejection/refund behavior. They are deterministic in-process fixtures, not
  packaged-runtime evidence.
- `HST_MissionConvoyOperationService`: owns schema 52 admission and runtime
  authority for newly started convoy missions. It freezes one persisted
  generated road route, exactly three vehicle slots, exactly three linked crew
  groups and their member slots, plus mission-kind-compatible cargo/captive
  authority assigned to vehicle zero. It advances the column virtually at 9 m/s,
  materializes
  within 1,800 m of a living player, folds beyond 2,200 m only when clear of
  contact, player occupancy, and unresolved interaction state, preserves exact
  crew casualties by frozen slot/entity identity and per-element vehicle state,
  confirms physical arrival
  from two distinct route-end samples, and settles only after the existing
  mission-convoy outcome owner has applied its once-only result. Historical
  restored convoy rows remain contract version `0` on the legacy timer/runtime
  path. Crew elimination can place unresolved money/prisoner/ammo/armored or
  other recoverable mission assets into an on-station recovery hold, keeping
  the exact operation open and reprojectable until the mission-specific outcome
  is actually resolved.
- `HST_MissionConvoyP1Policy`: supplies the small shared fail-closed policy
  surface for exact-convoy admission and restore. It enforces mission-specific
  cargo cardinality, role/kind, and loadable mission-asset entity requirements.
  Captives must be boardable characters with compartment access, while ordinary
  payloads must be non-character entities. The policy also owns
  the legal duty/resume and settlement/materialization/position pairs.
- `HST_MissionConvoySaveValidationService`: owns conservative schema-52
  migration, current-schema claimant validation, quarantine, derived-survivor
  normalization, and process-local restore cleanup. `HST_CampaignSaveData`
  delegates this boundary instead of carrying one compiler-heavy validator.
- `HST_MissionConvoyOperationProofService`: contributes nine focused
  `mission_convoy.*` assertions for atomic admission and rollback,
  virtual/projection and fold gating, casualty-stable restore, idempotent
  arrival/settlement, open/settled/recovery restore, aggregate-marker cleanup,
  and the materialization watchdog. Admission/corruption subfixtures reject
  invalid cargo, duplicate/hash/foreign authority, invalid seat topology,
  forged arrival receipts, illegal lifecycle pairs, and casualty authority on
  non-member roots, and preserve missionless exact-looking durable claimants.
  They are deterministic in-process fixtures, not packaged movement, rendering,
  or restart evidence.
- `HST_EnemyPatrolOperationService` and
  `HST_EnemyPatrolSaveValidationService`: own schema-53 exact authority for only
  newly queued enemy patrols, including proactive debit/settlement, generated-
  route outbound/lap/return state, exact projection transfer, legacy dispatch
  isolation, and `-53` quarantine.
- `HST_GarrisonPatrolOperationService`: owns schema-54 authority only for newly
  issued policy-v2 purchased resistance garrisons. It admits one exact arbitrary
  member roster under a non-self-populating group root, holds it as a virtual
  infinite local patrol, transfers only living slots through materialization/
  fold, and settles owner-change/all-dead/campaign-stop/setup or typed spawn/
  route-failure outcomes once without a refund. It never claims historical
  policy-v1, initial-map, enemy aggregate,
  vehicle, or multi-root garrisons.
- `HST_GarrisonPatrolSaveValidationService`: preserves every pre-schema-54
  garrison on its legacy representation, normalizes coherent current exact
  patrols to held survivor authority, and retains malformed current graphs under
  quarantine version `-54` without legacy conversion, refund, or guessed death.
- `HST_GarrisonPatrolOperationProofService`: contributes nine focused
  `garrison_patrol.*` assertions for admission, replay/rollback, roster
  projection, infinite route loop, projection/casualty hold, no-refund terminal
  settlement, restore, corruption quarantine, and marker lifecycle. They are
  deterministic source fixtures rather than packaged native behavior proof.
- `HST_MissionGuardOperationService`: owns schema-55 authority only for guard
  infantry admitted with a newly started `assassinate_officer` mission. It
  freezes one catalog-backed empty infantry root and ordered members, keeps the
  HVT outside the manifest and operation asset graph, holds the route-less roster
  on station, transfers only durable survivors through materialization/fold, and
  maps guard elimination or mission/owner/runtime outcomes to one zero-refund
  terminal receipt. It never claims historical officer missions, other
  assassination variants, or any other mission family.
- `HST_AssassinationGuardSaveValidationService`: preserves pre-schema-55 mission
  and HVT history at contract `0`, validates the exact mission/operation/
  manifest/batch/group graph, accepts compact settled authority, normalizes
  coherent physical state to held survivors, and retains malformed current rows
  under `-55` quarantine without legacy fallback, guessed casualty, HVT
  ownership, or refund. Quarantine remains diagnostic and does not terminate the
  otherwise playable HVT mission.
- `HST_MissionGuardOperationProofService`: contributes focused
  `mission_guard.*` source assertions for admission/legacy isolation, survivor
  projection, HVT-independent settlement, migration/restore, corruption
  quarantine, and existing-HVT marker/UI status. They are not native entity,
  adapter, save/restart, rendered UI, owner-change, campaign-setup, or packaged
  multiplayer evidence.
- `HST_ForceSpawnQueueService`: owns schema-44 durable per-projection spawn
  batches, bounded priority/FIFO work acquisition, verified callbacks,
  retry/deadline/cancellation cleanup, pin-aware terminal retention, reporting,
  dependency-ordered cleanup, a durable nonterminal `READY_FOR_HANDOFF` state,
  explicit post-handoff completion, once-per-actual-restore reconciliation, and
  schema-50/51 strategic holds plus the schema-52 convoy, schema-54 garrison-
  patrol, and schema-55 mission-guard roster holds. A held
  batch performs no generic queue work and
  uses its frozen member slots as exact living/dead roster authority.
- `HST_ForceSpawnAdapterService`: consumes eligible released queue work from the production
  one-second active-campaign coordinator tick. The first engine-facing slice
  creates exactly one infantry `SCR_AIGroup` root plus all frozen member slots,
  returns exact prefab/liveness/faction/native-group/Game Master/projection
  evidence, finalizes ready projections in physical war, and only then asks the
  queue to record success. For successfully handed-off exact infantry, it also
  maps authoritative life state back to the exact member slot, detaches confirmed
  dead members without deleting their corpses, and drives last-death cleanup.
  Its current-infantry validation now uses durable living slots after first
  handoff, allowing a schema-54 partial garrison survivor roster to rematerialize
  without restoring or requiring the original purchased count.

The remaining domain services are:

- `HST_EconomyService`: HR, faction money, support, aggression, war level,
  strategic score/control percentage, pacing recommendations, victory readiness,
  and balance diagnostics.
- `HST_MissionService`: mission eligibility, activation, deadlines, and
  completion rewards.
- `HST_PersistenceService`: campaign save-data migration/tracking, native
  Reforger checkpoint requests, autosave debouncing, and profile JSON fallback
  saves. Every real capture first reconciles mapped physical exact-convoy
  members; ambiguous authority defers the capture and retains its checkpoint
  intent for bounded retry without flushing stale state or requesting a
  savepoint.
- `HST_PersistenceSmokeTestService`: deterministic persistence fixture seeding
  and restore verification reports.
- `HST_RuntimeSettingsService`: `$profile:h-istasi/HST_Settings.json`
  load/create/migration and settings application to preset/balance data.
- `HST_AuthorizationService`: persistent members, guests, admins, and the
  first commander-vacancy policy.
- `HST_StrategicService`: ownership changes, town support, Petros penalties,
  activation flags, population-first victory/loss evaluation, and durable
  campaign-end state/reporting.
- `HST_HQService`: initial HQ selection, HQ movement, Petros/cache/arsenal/tent/spawn-point
  runtime objects, rebuilds, Petros-loss state, HQ knowledge, HQ threat scans,
  and Defend Petros diagnostics.
- `HST_ArsenalService`: item counts, unlock thresholds, finite/INF withdrawals,
  garage records, and vehicle redeploy.
- `HST_LootService`: area loot, vehicle cargo, garage vehicle capture, field
  vehicle snapshot/restore, and safe vehicle-root scanning.
- `HST_LoadoutEditorService`: saved loadouts, live loadout/storage nodes,
  candidate replacement, finite/INF cost ledgers, atomic apply/rollback, and
  issued-item accounting.
- `HST_BuildModeService`: dry-ground placement resolution for garage redeploys
  and HQ runtime-asset rebuilds.
- `HST_ConvoyOutcomeService`: mission-specific convoy arrival, capture,
  delivery, ammo-point, garage-handoff, and outcome de-dupe effects.
- `HST_CommandUIService`: procedural command-menu payloads, visible action
  routing, reports, tab/action gating, marker/UI audit coverage, command/report
  coverage checks, and failed-action text.
- `HST_EnemyDirectorService`: scaled enemy attack/support resource income by
  owned zone value and war level, plus validated spending against separate
  attack and support pools.
- `HST_PlayerLifecycleService`: connected-player registration, deterministic
  Workbench identity fallback, personal money, and rank.
- `HST_TownService`: resistance income, HR income, and town support changes.
- `HST_GarrisonService`: legacy aggregate garrison creation/fold-back plus the
  schema-54 exact purchased-manifest backlink and living-slot capacity reader.
- `HST_RecruitmentService`: troop training and abstract garrison recruitment.
- `HST_ZoneCaptureService`: capture helpers around strategic ownership
  changes.
- `HST_PlayerSpawnService`: custom FIA HQ spawn, Workbench identity fallback,
  native respawn requests, pending spawn tracking, and spawned-player records.
- `HST_PhysicalWarService`: player-proximity zone activation over the abstract
  garrison model, plus exact adapter registration/handoff and guards that keep
  legacy population, repair, survivor, route, patrol, and cleanup paths from
  duplicating queue-owned projections. For spawned support groups it owns live-
  member-centroid route state, two distinct-time-sample arrival/recall
  confirmation within 75m, direct current-to-target/exit chains, bounded route reissue, and
  transactional replacement of service-owned waypoint entities. Exact QRF
  handoff normalizes into `support_active` so this same route authority owns it.
  For non-queue-managed mixed personnel/vehicle groups it owns a separate
  personnel terminal predicate: vehicle health cannot substitute for living
  infantry after prior population evidence and population grace. Terminal
  cleanup zeros strategic strength, fails an unresolved linked QRF, unregisters
  combat ownership, and releases an intact vehicle as neutral salvage. An
  existing durable field/loot/garage record remains durable; otherwise the
  salvage record is session-only. HQ safety uses separate scopes: 900m remains
  the hostile operation-staging exclusion, but whole-location activation is
  blocked only inside the location capture footprint (at least 150m for legacy
  records). Zone composition uses its own 150m immediate-clearance guard. This
  split is implemented in source and awaits packaged behavior proof. For a
  schema-52 exact mission convoy, PhysicalWar is also the sole engine projection
  adapter: it realizes the durable mobile crewed elements plus any separated
  intact crewless asset roots during outbound travel and recovery hold, samples current
  position/survivors/damage/fuel back into those elements, and folds owned
  vehicle/group handles without inventing casualties or applying a mission
  outcome. Materializing roots remain unpublished until the complete projection
  is physical. Commit revalidates and publishes every vehicle, group, mapped
  member, and cargo participant atomically before closing the outbound
  transaction; terminal ground cargo can be the only required recovery root, and
  clean player-bound cargo no longer pins the column during delivery.
  For a schema-53 exact enemy patrol it also exposes the live-position, contact,
  exact-route restart, and bounded route-recovery evidence consumed by the patrol
  operation service. Exact patrol groups are excluded from legacy garrison-
  patrol, survivor-repair, route, fold, and cleanup ownership.
  For a schema-54 exact purchased-garrison patrol it supplies the corresponding
  live-position and persisted local-route restart boundary while excluding the
  group from legacy aggregate activation, composition, waypoint, population,
  survivor, fold, and cleanup owners.
- `HST_GeneratedContentService`: generated Everon mission sites, roadblock,
  support, stash, crashsite, and route records derived from stable zone
  anchors.
- `HST_MissionObjectiveService`: rough mission objectives, campaign task state,
  and no-admin objective progress hooks for broad-alpha mission families.
- `HST_MissionRuntimeService`: physical MVP mission primitives, world-condition
  objective polling, runtime inspection, and cleanup state. For a schema-52
  exact convoy it plans the three vehicle assets and optional cargo/captive
  before admission, then defers travel, arrival, and cargo-position authority
  to the mission-convoy operation instead of regenerating missing assets or
  resolving arrival from its legacy timer.
- `HST_SupportRequestService`: stateful FIA/enemy support calls,
  ETA/status/cooldown reports, native-safe ground support activation, physical
  or abstract resolution records, the schema-46 exact paid-QRF bridge from
  accepted manifest to queue-owned projection, and schema-47 survivor restore,
  elimination, and linked ledger settlement policies. ETA is only the earliest
  physical-arrival observation; spawned requests do not become
  `physical_arrived` or complete recall until physical war confirms current
  living-member distance. Recall mutation returns `HST_SupportRecallResult`
  with explicit accepted/already-applied/state-changed/terminal flags,
  disposition, failure, request, and operation identity. Exact paired full
  refunds validate both linked transactions and their settlement eligibility
  before either refund begins. New confirmed exact paid infantry QRFs also opt
  into the canonical operation contract. In schema 50 they begin as held virtual
  projections, follow the strategic route, run the narrow on-station virtual-
  combat policy, materialize exact survivors near a player, and fold exact live
  survivors back to the held roster after players leave the larger radius while
  the operation is clear of contact. Queue admission, projection transfers,
  restore, recall, and settlement update the same operation/request/group/
  manifest/batch identities. Route initialization occurs while duty is still
  `STAGING`; `LinkOutboundVirtual` commits delivered strategic service by moving
  duty to `OUTBOUND`. A terminal failure before that commit fully refunds money
  and HR. A later no-handoff materialization failure retains money and refunds
  only the operation's last virtual-friendly count, including from
  `ON_STATION`, with replay-idempotent settlement. Restore also clears the linked
  request's physicalized flag and publishes a virtual runtime status so request,
  operation, and held batch cannot disagree about projection ownership.
- `HST_CivilianService`: town reputation/support, wanted heat,
  police/roadblock presence and scans, aid incidents, undercover eligibility,
  request/application, enforcement, compromise, clear-state records, and
  disposable pedestrian/traffic projections. Ambient actors receive dedicated
  CIV group roots that inherit the stock behavior/pathfinding/utility/
  replication stack; initial members attach through the engine's AI-composition
  path, and the service owns their group, driver, and waypoint cleanup. Current
  source classifies stock town-center locations separately from minor localities,
  permits civilian projection even when HQ safety suppresses hostile military
  activation, selects deterministic non-repeating concrete appearances, defaults
  true towns to five driven vehicles, limits the known woodland locality to two
  pedestrians, and clears horn input only on HST-owned ambient drivers. These
  behavior corrections await a republished runtime test.
- `HST_EnemyCommanderService`: enemy resource spending into patrol, roadblock,
  QRF, counterattack, rebuild, support-call, and Petros attack orders with
  physical/abstract runtime state. Schema 51 routes only newly planned
  infantry-only defensive QRFs through `HST_EnemyQRFOperationService`; their
  exact runtime bypasses the fixed legacy resolve timer and legacy support-row
  physicalization. Schema 53 dispatches newly queued patrol orders by both type
  and contract version to `HST_EnemyPatrolOperationService`; their proactive
  attack debit, exact one-root roster, generated-route loop, physical/virtual
  transfer, return, and settlement bypass the legacy patrol timer. Historical
  patrols and every other order type keep contract-version-0 behavior.
- `HST_MapMarkerService`: native marker rebuild/publish behavior plus marker
  status/detail/audit reports for strategic zones, missions, objectives,
  Defend Petros, support, QRFs, HQ, and convoy state. Linked terminal-group
  state is checked before unresolved-QRF visibility, preventing a dead response
  from retaining a tactical marker. Schema-50 source labels static zones with
  location and owner and reports virtual exact player-QRF travel/on-station
  state. Schema 51 publishes one marker for every open exact enemy defensive-QRF
  operation at its strategic or live cursor with faction, living count, duty,
  immutable source/assignment, and ETA. Schema 52 publishes one aggregate
  marker for an open exact mission convoy at the operation's strategic/live
  position and suppresses the three misleading per-vehicle convoy markers.
  Recovery retains the same aggregate current and destination marker pair for
  cargo and vehicle outcomes; it never revives legacy per-vehicle/outcome IDs.
  Schema 53 publishes one roster-authoritative marker per open exact enemy patrol
  at its virtual cursor or live position, with duty and living-count context, and
  removes it after terminal cleanup.
  Schema 54 publishes one marker per open exact purchased-garrison patrol at its
  virtual/live position with assignment location, current owner, role, and
  durable survivor count. Forces UI reports exact patrol infantry separately
  from legacy aggregate infantry; neither presentation owns the roster.
- `HST_ZoneCompositionService`: runtime alpha composition slots for zone and
  mission physicalization diagnostics. Radio-site composition now retains a
  nearby intact authored transmitter instead of spawning a parallel tower; the mission
  runtime can borrow that damageable entity for destroy-target tracking without
  deleting it during generic cleanup. Generated towers remain a fallback for a
  missing or destroyed authored transmitter, including rebuild outcomes.

Static marker rendering has a separate client lifecycle boundary. A small
manager patch retries root creation before the stock static-marker update and
disables a marker that remains rootless. The rendered-map proof waits for the
delayed client pass and inspects actual active roots and widget components;
server publication/reconciler counts are reported only as native handles.
Config-backed modded classes on this path must also repeat the base class's
container metadata. A packaged schema-49 test verified that restoring the
original `BaseContainerProps` and custom-title attributes brought normal Game
Master and stock HUD initialization back. That run then exposed eighteen invalid
radio icon entries as giant boxes. Current source preserves the canonical placed-
marker table, appends or repairs a validated normal/glow radio icon by resource
identity instead of a hard-coded index, and rejects invalid entries. The map-
target prompt, target indicator, and dialog now share a map-local z-order below
the native workspace pointer. Those follow-up fixes still need packaged proof.

Static helper services keep repeated low-level behavior out of the coordinator:
`HST_WorldPositionService` resolves dry/safe positions and prefab spawning,
`HST_DisplayNameService` normalizes item and vehicle labels,
`HST_VehicleRootPolicy` centralizes safe vehicle-root eligibility,
`HST_VehicleCapabilityPolicy` classifies captured/source vehicles as ammo,
repair, fuel, armed, or transport sources, and
`HST_ConvoyVehicleControlAdapter` wraps native vehicle movement/seating calls,
registers valid pilotable vehicles with the crew utility before seating,
prefers forced authority-local entry for server-owned AI, and exposes a direct
retained-registration query for runtime proof.

The coordinator currently exposes server-only mutation methods that check
campaign phase, known IDs, and mission eligibility before changing state.
Client UI requests flow through player-owned request/RPC components and
ownership-resolved coordinator methods, so the server resolves the trusted
identity and enforces member, commander, and admin permissions instead of
trusting client-provided player IDs.

## Campaign Authority Boundary

Schema 43 extends the first campaign-authority foundation with exact force
planning. Schema 44 adds durable bounded SpawnQueue authority for executable
manifest projections. Schema 45 adds explicit force/projection identity on
active groups, durable Game Master registration evidence, dependency-ordered
cleanup, and the first engine-facing exact infantry adapter. Schema 46 makes
player-paid resistance QRF the first support consumer of the complete quote →
ledger → executable manifest → SpawnQueue → settlement path. None of these
schemas is a claim that every existing broad-alpha mutation uses the boundary.
Schema 47 adds durable exact-member casualty state, ever-populated/spawn-
completed terminal semantics, corpse-preserving root cleanup, and survivor-only
paid-QRF reprojection. Schema 48 bounds accepted quote/manifest/ledger history,
preserves compact issue/confirmation/transaction replay, and adds the missing
production caller for pin-aware terminal SpawnQueue maintenance.
Schema 49 adds a canonical, versioned operation aggregate for newly confirmed
exact paid player infantry QRFs and uniquely coherent active schema-48 rows.
That narrow slice is not a claim that legacy QRFs, other support, missions,
garrisons, enemy orders, or every force projection use the aggregate.
Schema 50 adds persistent strategic projection to that same narrow consumer:
direct-route progress, held exact roster authority, proximity hysteresis,
physical-to-virtual survivor transfer, bounded virtual infantry combat, and
restore normalization to one virtual projection. It does not migrate vehicles,
assets, convoys, garrisons, broad legacy supports, missions, or enemy orders.
Schema 51 adds a second, separately typed consumer: newly planned infantry-only
enemy defensive QRF orders. Admission freezes one prepaid roster from a distinct
same-faction operational source for a same-faction defended target under resistance pressure, links one operation/
batch/group aggregate, and suppresses a
parallel legacy QRF or support row for the same target. The force travels and
folds through the shared exact projection boundary, applies defensive pressure
once at its immutable assignment, returns to its immutable origin, and refunds
attack/support resources in proportion to exact survivors once. Pre-schema-51
orders, counterattacks, patrols, roadblocks, support calls, Petros attacks,
vehicles, garrisons, missions, and other force families remain contract version
`0` on their prior paths.
Schema 52 adds a third typed operation consumer and the first narrow exact
vehicle/multi-group aggregate: only a newly started `convoy_intercept` mission
is admitted with contract version `1`. Its frozen manifest contains exactly
three vehicle slots, one crew group per vehicle, ordered durable crew slots, and
an optional cargo/captive asset assigned to vehicle zero. Three durable convoy
element rows own per-vehicle position, survivor count, damage/fuel/ammunition
snapshot, disposition, and reciprocal mission/operation/manifest/runtime links.
  The operation owns generated-route progress, virtual movement, proximity
  materialization/fold, arrival, restore normalization, and terminal receipt;
  existing mission-outcome code remains the once-only reward/penalty owner.
  When crew elimination leaves cargo/captive/vehicle recovery unresolved, the
  operation remains open in an on-station recovery hold and may virtualize and
  rematerialize those assets instead of settling early.
Pre-schema-52 convoy rows remain contract version `0`, receive no invented
manifest/operation/element identity, and continue on the legacy path.
Schema 53 adds a fourth typed operation consumer: only newly queued enemy
`PATROL` orders receive contract version `1`. Admission freezes one infantry
root and its member slots, spends proactive attack resources once, and links one
order/route/operation/manifest/held-batch/group aggregate. A generic generated-
route cursor owns outbound travel, exactly one closed on-station lap, and a
separate return-to-origin leg. Virtual and physical projection share the frozen
roster; mapped casualties survive fold and restore, while physical contact holds
the route clock until clear. Return settles one survivor-proportional proactive-
attack refund. Type-plus-version dispatch keeps this policy isolated from the
exact defensive-QRF and legacy owners. Corrupt current-schema rows retain
diagnostic authority under quarantine version `-53` and never fall back to a
legacy timer. Historical patrol rows remain contract version `0` and receive no
invented route, roster, operation, or refund. Packaged schema-50 through
schema-53 certification remains independently open.
Schema 54 adds a fifth typed operation consumer: only a newly issued policy-v2
purchased resistance garrison receives `HST_OPERATION_TYPE_GARRISON_PATROL`
contract version `1`. Its immutable manifest contains one executable
`NotSpawned` container root and the arbitrary ordered members selected by the
quote. The accepted graph remains in strategic hold and walks a persisted local
route loop indefinitely while virtual; proximity projects only living slots and
fold retains exact casualties/cursor state. PhysicalWar excludes the exact group
from legacy aggregate garrison owners. Owner change, all-dead, campaign stop,
setup, or typed spawn/route failure records one
`exact_garrison_patrol_terminal` receipt with zero resource
refund and zero transfer into aggregate infantry. Policy-v1 purchases and all
initial/enemy aggregate, vehicle, and multi-root garrisons remain legacy.
Pre-schema-54 migration invents none of this authority; malformed current rows
retain quarantine version `-54`. Packaged schema-50 through schema-54
certification remains independently open.
Schema 55 adds a sixth typed operation consumer: only guard infantry for a
newly started `assassinate_officer` mission receives
`HST_OPERATION_TYPE_MISSION_GUARD` contract version `1`. The HVT remains outside
the exact manifest. One empty execution root and ordered member roster own a
route-less, offset guard assignment through strategic hold, physical projection,
mapped casualties, fold, re-entry, and zero-refund typed settlement. Guard
elimination settles `DESTROYED` without completing the HVT objective; HVT
success maps to `COMPLETED`, mission failure/expiry/campaign stop/setup to
`CANCELLED`, owner change to `INVALIDATED`, and coherent spawn/assignment failure
to `SPAWN_FAILED`. The operation has no route or virtual-combat owner. Historical
officer missions, other assassination variants, and all remaining mission
families remain contract `0`; pre-55 migration invents nothing. Malformed current
rows quarantine at `-55` without a legacy fallback, HVT backlink, guessed death,
or refund, and the diagnostic quarantine leaves the HVT mission playable. The
existing HVT marker and mission UI project guard strength instead of adding
another marker. Workbench compile/open, native entity/adapter/casualty behavior,
save/restart, rendered UI, owner-change, campaign-setup, networking, reconnect,
and JIP proof remain open.
The next planned mission-force cutover is guard infantry for newly started
`assassinate_traitor` missions only. This is a target, not a schema-56
implementation claim; `assassinate_specops` and all other mission families stay
legacy until separately versioned.

| Concern | Current implementation | Target architecture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stable identity | A persisted monotonic allocator creates authority IDs; garrisons, quotes, manifests, transactions, and selected support/order/group records carry explicit stable links. The two QRFs, exact convoy, exact enemy patrol, policy-v2 purchased-garrison patrol, and new officer-mission guard bind contract-version-1 identity to one canonical operation and projection graph. The HVT deliberately remains separate objective/runtime-asset authority. | Every durable operation, force, projection, command, transaction, and event has a stable ID and explicit links. |
| Command idempotency | Visible command requests carry request IDs; bounded receipts cover migrated training and quote/confirm commands. Support recall is the first production visible command to map a typed domain result into explicit receipt status and operation identity; its presentation sentence cannot turn an accepted terminal outcome into a rejection. Other visible commands still use the compatibility classifier. Full accepted state and schema-48 settlement tombstones prevent later duplicate issue/confirmation/ledger replay from charging again, including after QRF settlement. | Every player-visible and scheduled campaign mutation enters through a typed command envelope and produces one durable receipt. |
| Resource integrity | Troop training, visible garrison confirmation, and player-QRF confirmation/terminal settlement use the resource ledger. Exact player-QRF paths own paired refunds; enemy QRF and enemy patrol own separate proportional settlements. Schema-54 garrison patrol and schema-55 mission-guard terminal paths record deterministic receipts with zero refund. Other support/order consumers still use legacy services. | All resource changes use reserve/commit/cancel/refund transactions, with no direct debit paths outside the ledger. |
| Force exactness | A policy-v2 garrison quote freezes one non-self-populating executable root plus its arbitrary priced member slots; a newly started officer mission separately freezes one catalog-backed empty root plus ordered guard members, with no HVT, route, vehicles, assets, or resources in that manifest. The QRF, enemy-patrol, and convoy exact shapes remain unchanged. Historical officer missions, other mission families, policy-v1/initial/enemy aggregate garrisons, and garrison vehicles/multi-root forces remain outside these cutovers. | A quoted immutable force manifest is the only input to paid creation, and creation is all-or-nothing before any physical or virtual projection is published. |
| Force realization | SpawnQueue accepts frozen, hash-valid, all-required one-root infantry manifests. Both QRFs, exact enemy patrol, policy-v2 purchased-garrison patrol, and exact officer-mission guard begin held and release only durable living member slots; each empty root contributes no authored members. The schema-52 convoy keeps its separate three-element PhysicalWar adapter. Confirmed casualties remain retired across transfer/restore. Generic vehicle/asset/multi-root, historical mission guards, and historical aggregate-garrison realization remain unsupported. | One adapter realizes every supported manifest, registers each slot exactly once, restores successful projections safely, and feeds durable living-force/casualty/retirement authority without bypass paths. |
| Operation lifecycle | Schemas 50-54 retain player QRF, enemy QRF, exact convoy, enemy-patrol, and purchased-garrison behavior. Schema 55 adds a route-less on-station officer-mission guard with exact survivor transfer, HVT-independent `DESTROYED`, typed zero-refund mission/owner/spawn settlement, conservative restore, existing-HVT marker/UI status, and `-55` quarantine that preserves a playable HVT. Historical missions and every other support/order family remain outside these contracts. | Every force/order uses one versioned operation aggregate with event-driven engagement, strategic movement progress, physical/virtual transfer, settlement, and client/JIP projection. |
| Event history | New command and ledger decisions append to a bounded persisted campaign event log. | All authoritative state transitions emit typed events consumed by projections, UI, diagnostics, and restore reconciliation. |
| Certification | The stamped schema-54 tree identifies implementation `09a1470a4c27dbef866e8cbdba182a7df65fa027` and passes foundation, clean Workbench Game compile/create at 5,760 files/11,560 classes with CRC `c62de929`, and a ten-sample/20-second normal WorldEditor open. That historical evidence does not verify the current schema-55 tree. Schema-55 Workbench compile/open and all packaged native movement/casualty/fold, guard/HVT settlement, save/restart, rendered marker/UI, owner-change, campaign-setup, networking, reconnect, and JIP behavior remain open. | Isolated physical runtime, save/load/reprojection, dedicated-server, reconnect, and JIP evidence certifies the full boundary. |

Concurrent open garrison quotes are capped and expired/terminal unreferenced
planning rows can be pruned. SpawnQueue terminal projection rows have explicit
backlink pins, a 600-second minimum retention window, and a 128-row admission
bound; the production coordinator now supplies pins and runs that maintenance.
Schema 48 retains accepted rows in full for at least 600 seconds and while any
projection backlink exists, then atomically moves replay identity and final
transaction evidence into at most 256 tombstones with an 86,400-second minimum
window. Full quotes plus tombstones share a hard 320-row admission bound. An old
evicted quote fails closed rather than recreating a debit or aggregate mutation.

Until those target columns are closed, domain services remain authoritative for
their existing behavior, but they must not be described as uniformly
idempotent, ledger-backed, or exact-manifest driven.

Campaign-debug state isolation is fail-closed. Every in-process profile is
restricted to the development world. The persistence service first durably
captures the live campaign, the coordinator runs the suite against a deep-cloned
`HST_CampaignState`, checkpoints only isolated in-memory save data, and swaps the
untouched live state back on completion or cancellation. External/soak profiles
cannot enter this runner. This protects authoritative campaign persistence, but
does not roll back world entities, player inventory/health, delayed callbacks,
or service caches, so a development-session restart remains part of the safety
boundary.

## Authoring Contracts

The addon keeps authoring data separate from runtime state:

- `HST_CampaignPreset`: fixed scenario roles and capability switches.
- `HST_FactionTemplate`: faction identity and capability declarations.
- `HST_MapDefinition`: stable IDs for zones and hideout candidates.
- `HST_BalanceConfig`: campaign balance and progression values.
- `HST_MissionRegistryConfig`: mission definitions and deferred capabilities.

The current coordinator uses `HST_DefaultCatalog` as runtime authority. The
checked-in faction `.conf` resources are not loaded by that path and are not
guaranteed mirrors; they must not be cited as gameplay truth until one loader
and startup validator replaces the duplicated declarations. Schema-43 exact
force planning uses `HST_ForceCatalogService`, whose explicit catalog version
and ordered slots are validated against effective prefab containers at runtime.
Schema-44 queue admission consumes the frozen execution-prefab slots directly;
manifest identity binds the input but never substitutes for a projection or
idempotency key. Schema 45 keeps the group root and member entities as runtime
projections while persisting their force/projection links and registration
evidence. Schema 46 selects one authored player-QRF group, freezes all ordered
slots, and submits that exact manifest without invoking the broad composition
service. Schema 47 persists each exact member's living/retired lifecycle and
reuses the immutable manifest while excluding confirmed casualties from restore
reprojection. The current adapter deliberately rejects vehicle, asset, and multi-root
manifests instead of shortening them or falling back to broad composition.

## Persistence

The persistence service tracks `HST_CampaignSaveData` through
`PersistenceSystem`, applies restored state through a schema migration path,
and flushes the tracked scripted state before requesting
`SaveGameManager.RequestSavePoint` when saving is possible and allowed. The
service also writes `$profile:h-istasi/HST_CampaignSaveData.json` as a profile
fallback when scripted persistence cannot be flushed, and will load that file
if no restored `PersistenceSystem` state is available. The state model is
versioned from day one. `HST_CampaignSaveData` is the deep-copy save container
for current campaign fields and nested runtime arrays. Before autosave, major-
change, manual-checkpoint, or campaign-debug baseline capture, schemas 52 through
54 synchronously reconcile every mapped physical exact-convoy, exact-enemy-
patrol, and exact-garrison-patrol member. A physical or dematerializing patrol
must prove one unique handed-off
root, one unique live handle per durable survivor, matching result/projection and
slot keys, matching PhysicalWar membership, and an authoritative live position.
An unexplained deleted binding remains unresolved rather than becoming a casualty.
An open outbound publication transaction, missing/conflicting mapping, aliased or
cross-key runtime ownership, unverifiable physical patrol position, or nonphysical
operation retaining process-local member mappings defers capture before an older
tracked snapshot is flushed or an engine savepoint is requested. Quarantined
patrols also defer until both adapter and PhysicalWar runtime ownership are empty,
then retain the diagnostic graph under strategic authority without refund. The
pending checkpoint intent remains set and retries on the bounded debounce. Schema
53 persists the
monotonic authority sequence, bounded command receipts, resource transactions,
campaign events, stable operation/garrison links, immutable force manifests,
expiring quotes, durable per-projection spawn batches/slot evidence,
Game Master registration evidence, explicit active-group force/projection IDs,
support quote/capability/schedule fields, linked exact-QRF aggregate identities,
successful-handoff/reprojection counters, member casualty tombstones, active-
group ever-populated/spawn-completed/living-force evidence, and the queue
restore/reconciliation epochs, plus bounded accepted-settlement replay tombstones
and their final resource-status/refund evidence. It also persists canonical
exact-QRF operation records with immutable assignment, mutable tactical target,
typed duty/engagement/materialization/position/settlement state, execution links,
policy IDs, timestamps, terminal result, revision, direct-route cursor and
distance, strategic speed/update clock, projection decisions, virtual-combat
clock/damage carries, exact virtual force counts, strategic batch holds, enemy-
order source/manifest/service-commit/resource-settlement authority, reciprocal
enemy-order/operation/group backlinks, and distinct-second physical-arrival
confirmation state, plus exact enemy-patrol generated-route waypoint/lap/leg
cursor and loop clocks, proactive resource settlement, contact-held projection,
and reciprocal route/order/operation/manifest/batch/group identity, plus exact
mission-convoy operation/manifest/spawn/
settlement links, three durable convoy elements, per-element vehicle/crew/cargo
identity and state, mission-asset vehicle-slot assignment, generated-route
cursor, and exact convoy arrival/settlement authority,
  plus schema-54 exact purchased-garrison quote/manifest/garrison/operation/
  generated-route/held-batch/group links, local loop cursor, exact casualties,
  and no-refund terminal receipt, plus schema-55 exact officer-mission/operation/
  manifest/held-batch/group links, route-less guard anchor, exact casualties,
  typed terminal result, and separate HVT authority, alongside campaign
metadata, resources, campaign-end
reason/summary/elapsed second/control/war/zone-count fields, outcome-mode,
population/support, airfield metadata, support deployment proof, active-group
vehicle prefab, active-group route waypoint counts, runtime infantry waypoint assignment and final-sweep state,
HQ/Petros/cache/arsenal/tent/spawn-point fields,
faction pools, players, zones, garrisons, active groups, QRFs, map markers,
generated content, objectives, mission runtime, mission assets, support, enemy
order, civilian, undercover, arsenal, garage, vehicle cargo, runtime vehicle,
saved loadout, issued-item, ammo point, and captured-emplacement records.
Loadout editor sessions remain runtime/editor state, while durable saved
loadouts and issued-item ledgers are copied into the save container. Save compatibility
still needs broader Workbench restart/load soak testing before it is promised
to players. An actual persisted restore increments its epoch once, then the
coordinator reconciles the queue before garrison/player-QRF confirmation,
  schema-51 enemy-QRF authority, schema-52 mission-convoy normalization, schema-53
  enemy-patrol normalization, schema-54 purchased-garrison patrol normalization,
  schema-55 officer-mission guard normalization, and
open-resource reservations. Accepted exact
QRFs never reacquire saved entity IDs. Schema 50 clears process-local root/
member/native-group evidence and keeps one nonterminal batch in strategic hold;
schema 51 applies that same one-owner restore rule to its opted-in enemy QRF and
also clears its physical-arrival sample counters. Confirmed-dead slots remain
retired and only exact survivors can be released for later materialization. Interrupted
pending, `READY_FOR_HANDOFF`, and previously successful physical batches all
normalize to that same virtual authority instead of assuming an interrupted
handoff succeeded or respawning immediately. A post-handoff technical failure
still retains paid money and refunds durable survivors only. Terminal prefab,
verification, handoff, and casualty history remains evidence, while terminal
entity/native-group IDs are cleared rather than reacquired as living authority.

The schema-49 migration from schema 48 creates a contract-version-1 operation
only for a uniquely coherent accepted nonterminal exact paid player QRF. It preserves request,
quote, manifest, queue, group, transaction, and balance state and leaves every
pre-exact, terminal, archived-only, incomplete, or ambiguous row on contract
version `0`. Schema-50 migration opts only coherent exact infantry-QRF
operations into strategic projection. On every restore, a nonterminal opted-in
projection clears process-local entity IDs, becomes one held virtual batch with
strategic position authority, and retains exact survivor/casualty slots, duty,
assignment, economy, and terminal history. Unsupported or ambiguous aggregates
remain operation-only. These rules have deterministic source coverage but no
packaged process-restart evidence.

Schema-51 migration never invents exact authority for a historical enemy order.
Every pre-schema-51 enemy row remains contract version `0` with no backfilled
source claim, manifest, operation, service commitment, or refund. A current-
schema versioned enemy defensive QRF must restore with one coherent reciprocal
order/operation/manifest/batch/group aggregate or fail closed and preserve its
evidence for once-only resource settlement. Its physical runtime handles are
discarded, its exact casualty roster and route cursor remain durable, and its
projection resumes as one held virtual batch. Deterministic roundtrip fixtures
cover this shape in source; a real process restart remains unproven.

Schema-52 migration never opts a historical active convoy into exact authority.
Every pre-schema-52 convoy remains operation contract version `0`; migration
does not invent a route, manifest, vehicle slot, crew roster, cargo carrier,
convoy element, or settlement receipt. A current-schema open exact convoy must
restore as one coherent mission/operation/manifest/held-batch/three-element
aggregate or fail closed. Restore discards process-local vehicle/group handles
and physical arrival samples while retaining route progress, element positions,
vehicle state, cargo assignment, and confirmed crew casualties, then resumes
the operation virtually. Only member slots may carry casualty tombstones, open
authority must use an enumerated legal duty/resume and materialization/position
pair, and missionless or partially unlinked exact-looking rows remain durable
quarantine evidence instead of being deleted by generic cleanup. This shape is
  source-validated; physical
  rematerialization and real process restart remain packaged-runtime-open.

Schema-54 migration never opts a historical garrison into exact patrol
authority. Policy-v1 accepted purchases, initial-map and enemy aggregates, and
vehicle counts retain their prior representation with no invented operation,
roster, route, batch, casualty, or settlement. A coherent current policy-v2
graph clears process-local handles and resumes one held virtual survivor roster
on the same local loop. A malformed current graph is retained at quarantine
version `-54` without refund, guessed death, or aggregate conversion. Physical
and dematerializing rows join pre-capture root/member/PhysicalWar binding and
live-position validation; capture defers during a partial materialization wave
until its all-required handoff or terminal result is authoritative. This shape
has deterministic source proof and passes the stamped Schema-54 Workbench
compile/open gates. Native movement, fold, save/restart, networking, and JIP
remain packaged-runtime-open.

Normal adapter acquisition runs only after the campaign enters the active phase.
During setup and won/lost phases, the coordinator requests cancellation for all
nonterminal batches and keeps draining dependency-ordered cleanup with a
monotonic runtime-only clock. That cleanup clock advances retry/defer eligibility
without advancing campaign elapsed time. Schema 47 implements successful
survivor reprojection and casualty/retirement authority for the exact paid
infantry-QRF consumer. It confirms physical death only from a present slot-
mapped entity's authoritative life state; deletion or a missing entity is not
casualty evidence. Schema 50 adds virtual roster transfer, direct strategic
movement, materialization hysteresis, and narrow virtual combat for that same
consumer. Schema 51 reuses the exact infantry projection and casualty boundary
  for newly planned enemy defensive QRFs, but not the player-QRF virtual-combat
  policy. Schema 52 adds a separate exact three-vehicle mission-convoy projection
and atomic fold path. Terminal destroyed/captured vehicle roots retain any
living crew as stationary crew-only projections without vehicle resurrection,
and proximity ownership takes the nearest separated living/recoverable root;
  it does not generalize the SpawnQueue adapter or simulate off-screen combat.
  Schema 53 reuses the one-root infantry queue/adapter for newly queued exact
  enemy patrols, but gives them a generated-route loop, contact-held route clock,
  return-origin duty, and proactive survivor-refund policy distinct from both
  QRF consumers. Schema 54 reuses the same adapter only for newly issued
  policy-v2 purchased resistance garrisons, using an empty executable root,
  arbitrary exact member roster, infinite local loop, survivor-only
  rematerialization, and no-refund settlement.
Event-driven physical life-state subscription, generalized
vehicle/asset rosters, generalized folding, live physical engagement events,
and generalization to every force consumer remain open. Paid support is only partially migrated to
this path: player QRF is exact, while supply, search, roadblock, fire, and air
  support remain on legacy services. Historical policy-v1 garrison purchase
manifests remain nondeployable; initial/enemy aggregate garrisons and garrison
vehicles/multi-root forces remain on legacy PhysicalWar paths.

## World Layout

`Worlds/HST_Everon/HST_Everon.ent` is an original subscene over vanilla
Everon. Named layer files reserve ownership boundaries for physical authoring.
Strategic IDs live in `Configs/HST/Maps/HST_Everon.conf` so persistence does
not depend on fragile entity names.

The checked-in world shells include a base-backed AI world with explicit Eden
soldier and vehicle navmesh configs, a perception manager, faction, loadout,
radio, chat, and respawn managers so Workbench can initialize without relying
on Conflict's strategic brain.

Direct `.ent` Play mode no longer depends on the stock Deployment Setup menu.
The coordinator is an `SCR_BaseGameModeComponent`, so it receives game-mode
state and player-connected callbacks directly. It also runs a short frame sweep
for connected players without controlled pawns, which covers Workbench timing
where player `1` exists before its respawn component is ready. The respawn
system remains as possession plumbing, but its spawn logic is
`HST_PlayerSpawnLogic`, which delegates to `HST_PlayerSpawnService`. The
service registers the connected player as FIA, submits an `SCR_FreeSpawnData`
request for the default FIA rifleman at the selected HQ hideout, tracks the
request as pending, and records player state only when the native spawn
callback reports success. This prevents the Workbench frame sweep from
creating duplicate bodies while Reforger is still finalizing ownership.

`StartingPoints.layer` still contains FIA-affiliated Scenario Framework
spawnpoint slots and FIA role-selection loadouts, but those are now authoring
metadata and a debug fallback, not the normal player-side path. US
remains the occupier in the strategic preset. Game Master-spawned characters
are still not expected to advance h-istasi's player lifecycle. Workbench
offline play may log blank identity ID errors from stock reconnect or
editable-entity systems; treat those as non-blocking if a character is spawned
and possessed.

`HST_HQService` owns the server-side HQ lifecycle: setup-driven initial hideout
selection, HQ movement between authored hideouts, Petros/cache/arsenal/tent/spawn-point
runtime positions, and Petros-loss penalties. Runtime Petros spawning tries the
custom h-istasi prefab first through its GUID-qualified metadata resource and
falls back to the base FIA character only if that resource cannot spawn. The HQ
arsenal uses a GUID-indexed HST supply-cache prefab whose contextual actions
open the same Arsenal/Loot menu path used by the I-key menu and the custom
loadout editor path, with inherited stock arsenal actions filtered out. A stock
FIA cache fallback is only used if the custom object cannot spawn.

The alpha HQ menu is procedural rather than layout-resource loaded. The server
keeps the existing `HST_MENU`, `TAB`, `STATUS`, `RESULT`, and `ACTION` payload
lines while adding optional `STAT`, `SECTION`, `ROW`, and `FEED` lines for the
h-istasi overview, HQ/Petros, missions, map/war, forces, arsenal/loot,
garage/build, members, and admin panels. The custom loadout editor has its own
`HST_LOADOUT_EDITOR` and `HST_LOADOUT_CANDIDATES` payloads but still routes
mutations through the same server-authoritative request bridge. Contextual
Petros, HQ arsenal, and vehicle cargo actions call the same bridge as menu
clicks so local hosts and MP clients follow one command path.

## Campaign Framework Spine

The first campaign loop is now connected as a physical/abstract hybrid. Zones
carry type, position, income, support, activation radius, route IDs, mission
site IDs, and garrison-slot data in `HST_CampaignState`; garrisons are stored
as infantry and vehicle counts. The physical-war service marks zones active
when players enter their activation radius, converts abstract garrison counts
into route-aware active groups, and folds survivor counts back before
deactivation. A mixed group with previously observed personnel becomes terminal
when its living infantry reaches zero after delayed-population and live-count
grace, even if its attached vehicle remains intact. That vehicle becomes
unclaimed, detached salvage and no longer contributes to garrison,
capture, QRF, or marker strength; vehicle-only projections keep their existing
separate semantics. Existing durable field ownership/cargo is preserved; an
unadopted salvage record is session-only. Eliminated/spawn-failed save normalization preserves zero
counts and clears process-local spawn identity rather than reconstructing
original force totals; folded rows retain the survivor counts already returned
to the abstract garrison.
Broad-alpha services generate mission sites/routes, attach
objectives/tasks to started missions, poll physical MVP mission primitives from
world conditions, spend scaled enemy pools into orders/support calls, and let
orders/support either physicalize near players or resolve abstractly off-screen.
The schema-50 exception is the newly confirmed exact paid infantry QRF: its
single operation and frozen member roster move continuously through virtual,
materializing, physical, dematerializing, and virtual states rather than using a
one-shot abstract outcome. Schema 51 applies the same projection ownership to
new infantry-only enemy defensive-QRF orders, with a distinct source/target,
arrival-pressure, return, and resource-settlement policy. Schema 52 gives only
new mission convoys their own generated-route virtual cursor and exact
three-element physical projection; it does not opt historical convoys or other
  missions in. Schema 53 opts only newly queued patrol orders into one generated-
  route outbound/lap/return policy; historical patrols remain legacy. Schema 54
  opts only newly issued policy-v2 purchased resistance garrisons into an exact
  indefinitely looping local patrol and leaves historical/initial/enemy aggregate
  garrisons legacy. All five paths remain intentionally isolated from broad
  legacy support, non-convoy missions, and every other enemy order family.
HQ knowledge feeds HQ threat, Defend Petros, markers, and campaign-end pressure;
civilian town support and undercover enforcement feed wanted heat, roadblock and
police scans, and HQ exposure. Civilian render eligibility is separate from the
hostile military activation bit so HQ safety does not erase nearby town life.
Radio compositions prefer an existing world transmitter, and radio destroy
missions can borrow it as their tracked damage target. Loot, vehicle cargo,
virtual garage, build
placement, vehicle capability classification, and loadout editor systems are
owned by campaign state instead of stock arsenal behavior. Mission success,
failure, timeout, convoy outcome, support resolution, enemy orders, vehicle/cargo
paths, and civilian aid mutate economy, support, capture progress, arsenal,
garage, aggression, HQ threat, and victory/loss readiness. Coordinator hooks
expose deterministic server-only actions for Workbench tests and no-admin player
actions for setup, random missions, support requests/cancel, civilian aid,
undercover status/checks, looting, vehicle cargo, garage capture/redeploy,
loadout application, marker/command audits, balance/campaign-end reports,
income, training, recruitment, and HQ moves.

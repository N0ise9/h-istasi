# Partisan: Everon

The current sealed source checkpoint is Campaign Schema 67 while runtime
settings remains Schema 24. Its exact identity is implementation
`2798cb20b824ed74419ab6dc9bdce03f18ef71df`, UTC
`2026-07-12T23:46:02Z`, and label
`schema67-settings24-enemy-strategic-resource-authority`; Foundation passes at
736 script-symbol references. Final stamped normal log
`logs_2026-07-12_19-52-14` and all-five log
`logs_2026-07-12_19-52-36` both compile 5,809 Game files/11,751 classes with CRC
`a353fa0d`. All-five reports `Script validation successful` for WORKBENCH, PC,
XBOX, PS4, and PS5; zero HST script errors were observed and zero Workbench
processes survived cleanup. This checkpoint begins Blueprint Phase 9 source work
without claiming that the Blueprint Phase 8 runtime exit is certified.

The product and repository names are now **Partisan: Everon** and **Partisan**.
`HST_*` source/resource names and the non-public `histasi` Workbench project ID
remain the internal implementation convention.
The existing `$profile:h-istasi` directory is also retained deliberately as the
legacy persistence namespace so current campaign saves, settings, debug
artifacts, and personal loadouts remain discoverable after the branding change.

The Schema-67 contract makes each versioned `HST_FactionPoolState` the canonical
attack-resource, support-resource, and aggression authority for one enemy role.
Bounded replay-safe `HST_EnemyStrategicMutationState` receipts freeze the
faction, mutation kind, per-faction operational sequence, before/delta/after
values, source identity, campaign time, and linked order/operation/accounting
evidence. One server API owns enemy income, spend, refund, aggression, and live
admin/debug pool adjustment. It rejects underflow and overflow atomically,
returns exact replay without mutation, and fails closed when an existing identity
is reused with different facts. A zero-effect operational command still records
one durable receipt so a zero-cost debit or zero-refund settlement cannot become
an untracked replay gap.

Occupier and invader authority remains independent, including persisted per-role
resource-income/aggression-decay accumulators and last-processed bucket
checkpoints. Periodic income/decay keeps at most one compact receipt per enemy
and kind. Operational receipts are never compacted or evicted in Schema 67: each
enemy role has a hard 4,096-receipt lifetime admission limit, and reaching it
fails later operational mutations for that role while the rival role and periodic
cadences remain independent. Invalid/orphan/rejected-role receipts are attributed
and quarantined, then removed before capacity checks so malformed rows cannot
consume either role's valid receipt budget. Existing exact defensive-QRF and enemy-patrol debit
and refund links use the shared resource authority without changing those
operation contracts; restore also checks reciprocal order, support-ledger,
town-influence, and ownership-transition links. Unsupported enemy order families remain explicitly
legacy/deferred; this slice neither exactifies them nor makes their planning
decisions durable. Pre-67 migration adopts each valid pool's current balances/
aggression and the valid legacy resource/aggression cadence accumulators as the
baseline, initializes matching cadence bucket checkpoints, and starts with an
empty mutation history. It does not
infer receipts from older totals or invent history, spend, refunds, orders, or
settlements. Malformed current Schema-67 graphs quarantine at `-67` rather than
falling back. Mission success/failure/expiry preflights and admits its strategic
plan before terminal status/reward/capture publication, and ownership aggression
admission precedes security/support replacement and owner publication. Rejection
therefore leaves the outer operation retryable instead of half-published.
Campaign Debug runs resource/order cases on nested state clones; its focused
physical-response case materializes and cleans only its supplied group while
restoring shared marker and AIWorld state. Persisted per-enemy planning cadence
and a frozen target/source/order/cost decision fingerprint are the immediate
next Phase 9 source slice and remain unimplemented. All Schema-67 source
fixtures are wired into Campaign Debug, but they have not been executed; the
native, real-restart, package, multiplayer, and soak evidence also remain
pending.

The immediately preceding sealed source/Workbench checkpoint is Campaign Schema 66 while runtime
settings remains Schema 24. The sealed Schema-66 stamp identifies implementation
`a7031797e67d99a99a066038cd8fa39efc03cff1`, UTC
`2026-07-12T20:28:33Z`, and label
`schema66-settings24-local-security-marker-integrity`. This Blueprint Phase 8 source slice gives each
eligible canonical enemy-held town one exact local-security patrol epoch. A
deterministic patrol envelope owns an authored 2–5 member frozen manifest, one
typed operation, one held SpawnQueue projection, and one exact survivor roster.
The patrol materializes only while its town is active; leaving the render bubble
reconciles physical casualties, retires native handles, and returns the same
living slots to strategic hold. Restore performs the same fold to held virtual
authority. Process-local cyclic waypoints are never save-game truth, and neither
fold nor restart refills dead members.

Complete destruction records one exact `local_security_patrol_destroyed` town-
influence event with police `-1` and zero support, reputation, heat, population,
roadblock, ownership, or aggression effects. That terminal epoch cannot reopen
merely because police pressure is still positive. A new epoch requires a newer
canonical ownership revision or a later applied event that positively increases
police pressure. Ownership change, cleared pressure, setup/campaign stop, and
spawn failure retire the patrol without inventing the destruction loss. The
ownership service preflights and settles this authority before publishing a new
owner, and persistence reconciles every open physical/dematerializing patrol or
defers capture. Resistance-held towns now drift automatic civilian police and
roadblock pressure to zero; the separate conservative resistance garrison policy
is unchanged.

Schema-66 migration preserves logical police, roadblock, owner, support, and
garrison facts but removes backlink-free disposable legacy police projection
rows. It invents no roster, casualty, operation, fold credit, or refund. Current
malformed exact graphs quarantine at `-66` and remain isolated from generic
group cleanup. Deterministic source proofs cover catalog/admission replay,
enemy-town eligibility, casualty-preserving fold/restore, destruction replay,
non-loss settlement, owner-revision/positive-pressure rearm, and conflict
quarantine. Foundation passes at 729 script-symbol references. Final stamped
normal and all-five Workbench checks are clean at 5,806 Game files/11,740
classes with CRC `ec860be7`; all-five reports `Script validation successful`,
both runs exited `0`, zero HST script errors were observed, and zero Workbench
processes survived cleanup. Campaign Debug execution, native spawn/waypoint/
casualty/fold behavior, real save/restart, packaged multiplayer, and soak
evidence remain open.

That sealed source pass also repairs the campaign-marker ownership regression introduced
by the Schema-61 client-local projection change at commit `27672e6`. Protected
campaign markers are now inserted as system-owned (`owner -1`) and non-removable
from their first visible frame. A readiness keepalive verifies native marker
identity, position, text, icon, flags, ownership, and removal policy, then
rebuilds a deleted or mutated projection from the authoritative client registry.
Player-created/dynamic player markers remain on their separate path and remain
editable. Packaged host/client manual delete, move, edit, self-heal, reconnect,
and JIP proof is still required.

The previous sealed checkpoint is Campaign Schema 65/runtime-settings Schema 24.
It
identifies implementation `609add9eeadf73816764c497178e2d35081307d1`, UTC
`2026-07-12T18:30:29Z`, and label
`schema65-settings24-civilian-consequence-authority`. It extends the sealed
ambient runtime without making disposable actor topology authoritative. Logical
town population, faction support, reputation/wanted heat, and enemy aggression
remain durable even when no pedestrian is rendered. Each locality also persists
a revisioned combat-danger episode envelope: current danger, episode and applied-
receipt counts, the consumed combat-presence revision, transition time, panic
deadline, last consequence ID, and fail-closed authority diagnostics.

The server game-mode destruction callback now identifies an exact tracked
civilian victim and retains it for admission to a 256-row casualty queue. A
separate 64-row queue owns deferred theft receipts. The callback never performs
the political mutation itself: the server drains at most four combined
consequence transactions per frame before claim observation and persistence.
Rejected rows retry indefinitely with a bounded 5/10/15-second backoff, and a
full queue retains the observation instead of discarding or re-identifying it.
Any retained observation, queued receipt, or queue-authority fault defers save
capture. A dead-character health check is a once-only fallback. Accepted
canonical-town casualties use the exact town-influence boundary to update
population, support, reputation, wanted heat, and any attributable enemy
aggression. Exact replay is read-only and a reused ID with different facts fails
closed.

A civilian vehicle theft consequence is admitted only after the live vehicle has
successfully crossed into durable `field_vehicle` authority. Its event ID is
derived from that durable vehicle ID. Only an exact resistance player in a pilot
seat can claim a civilian traffic/static vehicle for theft; passenger-only roots
remain non-recyclable during budget/health cleanup until exit or pilot claim but
do not promote or create a theft receipt. Nearby combat similarly consumes only the current combat-presence
revision and its exact current-operation/recent-fire counts. `HOT` or cooling
status by itself is deliberately inert, so a routine garrison cannot create
repeated civilian pressure. Any previously opened but unapplied combat receipt
drains before a new edge is admitted. A new danger edge opens one durable
episode and can apply at most one canonical-town political event; continued
observations refresh the envelope without replaying the event.

Physical pedestrians now follow the bounded `Wandering -> Panicked -> Recovering`
path. A danger or exact casualty threat replaces wander behavior with a running
move waypoint away from the threat; expiry restores walking/wander behavior only
after native waypoint acknowledgement. Panic-route loss/stall uses its own
bounded recovery counter, while repeated danger extends or re-enters panic
without consuming the ordinary stuck-recovery budget. Route maintenance does not
re-run AI activation on the hot path. This slice does not add a traffic panic
state. Minor localities still have no canonical political town
record: casualty and nearby-combat observations may drive panic only, using a
bounded session-memory receipt fingerprint, while vehicle-theft political
consequences require a canonical town. That minor-locality de-duplication receipt
does not survive restart and never invents support, population, heat, or
aggression history.

Schema-64 saves migrate by initializing the new episode envelope from the exact
current-operation/recent-fire facts already stored on each zone. An active
baseline becomes the adopted applied floor and receives a bounded panic deadline,
but migration does not create or replay a casualty, theft, combat, town-
influence, or strategic aggression event. The adopted floor is limited to zero
or one, and current authority requires `episode - lastApplied <= 1`. Pre-65 town
events receive empty aggression evidence. Current Schema-65 restore builds
bounded event/receipt indexes, validates each live town's last-event backlink and
the structural aggression before/after/strategic chain, and then checks the
aggression target against the live preset after restore because faction roles
are not serialized. Every post-adoption live combat event must also retain the
canonical fingerprint: heat `+4`, zero other political/aggression/population
effects, exact source/reason, and unchanged support/population before/after.
Structural or preset-role inconsistency is quarantined
instead of guessed. Exhausted stable-ID authority also fails strategic admission
before mutation rather than wrapping.

The deterministic state-only proof suites are complete and wired for casualty
policy and attribution, replay/conflict handling, theft, `HOT`-only rejection,
danger episode edges, minor-locality panic-only behavior, malformed authority,
aggression admission, save-copy/restore validation, and pedestrian panic/
recovery transitions. They do not create native entities or perform real profile
I/O. Campaign Debug execution, native callback/waypoint behavior, real save/
restart, rendered observation, packaged server/client and multiplayer proof, and
the ten-town/ten-minute stutter/churn soak remain open. Final stamped normal
compile/create and all-five-configuration validation are clean at 5,802 Game
files/11,728 classes with CRC `c0a672b9`; all-five reports `Script validation
successful`, both runs exited `0`, zero HST script errors were observed, and
zero Workbench processes survived cleanup. The immediately preceding unstamped
CRC `be076102` remains preliminary evidence only. Foundation passes at 717
script-symbol references. Native, package, real-profile, multiplayer, and soak
gates remain open.

The previous sealed checkpoint is Campaign
Schema 64/runtime-settings Schema 24. It identifies implementation
`6afadc7c13681b78171939a740862e52328beffd`, UTC
`2026-07-12T15:57:55Z`, and label
`schema64-settings24-ambient-runtime-authority`. Its final sealed-tree evidence is
Foundation at 711 script-symbol references, normal compilation at 5,799 files/
11,718 classes with CRC `bb083672`, successful validation for all five
configurations, zero HST script errors, and zero surviving Workbench processes.

The preceding sealed checkpoint is campaign Schema 64 on runtime-settings
Schema 23. `HST_TownInfluenceRecord` is its sole political support and town-
population authority for curated towns, with FIA, occupier, and invader support
stored separately in basis points. Compatibility support and population fields
are migration/read-only projections. Political flips use strict hysteresis
(`>8000` basis points for resistance ownership and `<4000` for enemy ownership)
and can change ownership only through `HST_OwnershipTransitionService`. The
Schema-64 Map/War model uses contacted-town Zone Pressure, current town first,
plus a complete deterministic Resistance Territory list. Incremental influence
aggregates scan event history only when a recorded expiry is due, and verbose
active-group survivor/count logs are throttled to 30 seconds.

That preceding sealed Schema-64/settings-23 checkpoint identifies implementation
`6f3c913eaed66926cce38b2ecafcff94084898a3`, UTC
`2026-07-12T11:28:41Z`, and label
`schema64-canonical-town-influence`. The full Foundation gate passes at 696 script-symbol references,
including the dedicated Schema-64 checks. Normal Workbench compilation and
explicit validation for all five configurations pass: the Game module loaded
5,793 files/11,695 classes with CRC `36d5b017`, validation reported success,
and no HST script errors were present. Every Workbench instance was closed and
the post-run process count was zero. Campaign Debug, packaged runtime, real
save/restart, rendered UI, stutter measurement, and multiplayer proof remain
pending for that sealed checkpoint.

Schema 63 is an earlier sealed source/Workbench checkpoint. It identifies implementation
`85a75c65e9c148a890d8d78b0288ae6483a5ccd9`, UTC
`2026-07-12T08:22:05Z`, and label
`schema63-canonical-combat-presence`.

Schema 62 is an earlier sealed canonical-ownership checkpoint under implementation
`7c93e0a485bcabe5a364c0b0cfeca235accb50f7`, UTC
`2026-07-12T06:11:19Z`, and label
`schema62-canonical-ownership-transition`. Foundation passes with 670 script-
symbol references. Headless Workbench Game validation loaded 5,785 files/11,652
classes with CRC `22c13a32` and zero script errors; the normal Script Editor open
remained responsive without a crash, and zero Workbench processes survived the
test. Schema 61 is the preceding sealed marker-projection foundation. Packaged
and runtime proof remains open.

Partisan is an original Arma Reforger resistance-campaign implementation. The
first preset targets Everon with a three-way war:

- FIA: player resistance
- US: occupying force
- USSR: invading force

## Current Status

The repository contains a broad-alpha campaign foundation:

- Reforger base-game project dependency only
- APL-ND licensing and third-party attribution
- Original Everon and compact development scenario shells
- Data contracts for presets, factions, maps, zones, balance, and missions
- A versioned campaign-state model with arsenal, vehicle cargo, garage,
  saved-loadout, issued-item, mission-runtime, active-group, support, exact
  infantry/convoy/rescue/local-security operations, radio-site lifecycle, build-mode,
  campaign-end, persistence metadata, and sealed Schema-67 versioned enemy
  strategic pools/mutation receipts
- Server-authoritative campaign, economy, mission, persistence, arsenal, loot,
  loadout-editor, garage/build, and native-checkpoint services
- A 39-entry configured mission-registry baseline
- Custom FIA HQ player spawn path for direct Workbench Play mode
- FIA spawnpoint/loadout authoring metadata for authored hideout candidates
- Setup-phase HQ selection, HQ movement, and Petros state hooks for the first
  playable resistance-campaign slice
- Abstract campaign systems for player lifecycle, town income/support, zone
  capture, garrisons, recruitment/training, and mission rewards/penalties
- Native respawn-request bootstrap with pending spawn tracking to avoid
  Workbench duplicate-spawn loops
- Everon alpha anchors, generated-route response movement, routed infantry
  move/sweep waypoints, mixed response vehicle spawning, and route-aware zone
  activation scaffolding for the physical AI war
- Dedicated Petros character prefab at
  `Prefabs/Characters/HST/Character_HST_Petros.et` for HQ contextual actions,
  with GUID metadata and a base-FIA spawn fallback only if the custom resource
  fails to spawn
- HST-owned HQ arsenal action surface at
  `Prefabs/Objects/HST/HST_HQArsenal.et`; stock FIA arsenal/MSAR behavior is
  not used for item authority, issuing, or loadout accounting, and inherited
  stock arsenal actions are filtered away from the Partisan action surface
- Custom Partisan loadout editor with a client fullscreen widget, server-built
  payloads, live equipment/storage nodes, compatible candidate replacement,
  five fixed personal loadout slots under `$profile:h-istasi/loadouts/v2`,
  finite/INF accounting, atomic apply/rollback, and an issued-item ledger owned
  by campaign state
- Procedural Partisan `I` key HQ menu mounted on both development
  worlds with Setup, Overview, HQ/Petros, Missions, Map/War, Forces,
  Arsenal/Loot, Garage/Build, Members, and Admin tabs
- First-load server settings generation at `$profile:h-istasi/HST_Settings.json`
  with config-backed defaults for campaign, factions, economy, membership,
  world activation, arsenal/loot, persistence, logging, and feature toggles,
  including configurable infinite stamina, live resistance support group map
  tracking, and population-based campaign outcomes
- Server-side area and vehicle loot actions that deposit eligible nearby gear
  into the campaign arsenal or vehicle cargo, remove transferred source items
  when configured, and reject raw visual/support assets
- Virtual garage and build-mode scaffolding for nearby vehicle capture,
  safe-root validation, cargo preservation, dry-ground redeploy placement,
  field-vehicle snapshot/restore, and HQ runtime-asset rebuilds
- Broad-alpha campaign scaffolding for generated Everon sites/routes, mission
  objectives, campaign tasks, physical mission-runtime primitives, support
  requests, enemy commander orders, civilian town state, and player undercover
  state
- HQ knowledge/threat state and Defend Petros linkage across mission, enemy
  order, support request, attacker-group, marker, and campaign-end state
- Enemy commander orders and support requests that can physicalize near players
  or resolve abstractly off-screen while preserving runtime status and outcome
  diagnostics
- Physical enemy response fold-back for support/QRF groups that leave the event
  bubble, preserving survivor state while removing live runtime handles
- Sealed Schema-63 canonical combat presence with one shared query/heat
  service for capture, mission contact, HQ threat, civilian safety, and enemy
  strategy. Fresh registered physical samples distinguish conscious dismounted
  infantry, usable occupied armed mobile vehicles, and usable occupied static
  weapons; cargo and empty, destroyed, burning, or immobile platforms do not
  contribute. Durable zone diagnostics transition `HOT -> COOLING -> COLD` with
  a runtime-settings Schema-23 default cooling window of 30 seconds. Unresolved
  spawned-group authority invalidates the query and blocks capture/safety
  decisions instead of guessing; capture also accepts only conscious character
  players, never spectator or Game Master proxies. Contribution, authority-gap,
  and radius-result caches plus an indexed physical registry and reusable
  sampling buffers keep the one-second path allocation-light. Foundation,
  normal Workbench compile/create, and explicit five-configuration Script
  validation pass; Campaign Debug and packaged runtime execution remain open.
- Mixed personnel/vehicle active groups now use living personnel—not an intact
  empty vehicle—as combat-effectiveness authority. Once previously observed
  personnel reach zero outside population grace, the group becomes terminal,
  contributes no capture pressure, retires its linked QRF marker, and preserves
  an intact attached vehicle as neutral salvage. Unadopted vehicles are session-
  only; an existing durable field record and cargo remain durable. Terminal zero-survivor
  truth is retained across save normalization; the bounded lifecycle proof is
  implemented, while real combat/salvage/restart observation remains open.
- Physical support route truth that keeps spawned support state on the live
  member centroid, treats ETA as the earliest arrival observation rather than
  completion, requires two live samples from distinct elapsed seconds within
  75m for arrival or
  recall exit, and rebuilds direct current-to-target/exit waypoint chains with
  at most three consecutive reissues without an 8m new-best distance
  improvement. Pre-repair restored arrival/exit rows receive one current live-
  distance revalidation. Fresh
  packaged movement, arrival, and recall proof remains open.
- Sealed Schema-64 canonical town influence. One revisioned
  `HST_TownInfluenceRecord` per curated town owns FIA, occupier, and invader
  support in basis points; initial, remaining, and destroyed population;
  explicit contact evidence; influence aggregates; and pending flip authority.
  The population-scaled support formula is pinned to reference commit
  `6e4226d3863ca8673535386c2fff8b6e08a806c4`: a raw `+1` yields `+100`,
  `+200`, and `+50` basis points at initial populations 100, 25, and 400.
  Resistance ownership requires strictly more than `8000` basis points and
  enemy ownership strictly less than `4000`; equality stays neutral. Every
  resulting owner change enters `HST_OwnershipTransitionService`. Legacy zone
  and civilian support/population fields are projections for compatibility and
  migration, not alternate mutation authorities. Every current exact event
  records the initial/remaining/destroyed population triple before and after
  mutation. Authorized absolute debug seeds use that same event boundary, and
  current restore rejects a broken population chain or final-record mismatch at
  `-64`. Foundation and Workbench compile/validation gates pass; the
  deterministic fixtures have not executed.
- Sealed Schema-64 Map/War projection shows only explicitly contacted
  canonical towns under Zone Pressure, places the current town first, then
  sorts the rest by ascending FIA support and stable name/ID ties. Resistance
  Territory publishes every canonical, published resistance-owned strategic
  zone in deterministic type/name/ID order. It shares the marker projection's
  completed-parent ownership resolver, so nested changes remain hidden until
  their parent transition publishes. Simon's Wood remains an ambient-only
  minor locality, and Maiden's Bay remains the Logistics Warehouse without a
  political town record.
- The sealed Blueprint Phase 8 ambient slice gives all eligible localities one
  deterministic global projection plan. Pedestrian floors precede traffic
  floors, then a rotating one-actor-per-town fair remainder shares both the
  actor cap and the nested traffic cap; traffic drivers count against both.
  Allocation priority is leased for at least 120 seconds and reconciliation
  starts from a rotating town cursor. Default daytime, low-heat traffic demand
  is five cars for a true town only when remaining population, the global
  budgets, and other locality demand permit it; five simultaneous cars per town
  is not guaranteed. Combined pedestrian/driver demand is capped to the unique,
  GUID-qualified appearance pool, preserving traffic demand first; exhaustion
  fails closed instead of cloning an appearance already visible in that locality.
  War level can reduce both global budgets.
- Ambient roots use explicit transactional lifecycle records. A pedestrian is
  admitted only after a living CIV group member and current wander waypoint are
  observed. Traffic admission requires a living CIV driver in the exact pilot
  compartment, an engine confirmed running, and an active current route
  waypoint. Pending transactions reserve capacity without appearing ready;
  admitted actors are sampled on the configured health cadence and either
  replan with bounded backoff or recycle after the configured recovery limit.
  Each actor owns an immutable per-zone/kind projection slot; recovery uses that
  slot plus its recovery count to rebuild a distinct deterministic route. Four
  root transactions per global update bound burst work, and the scoped Campaign Debug Phase 20
  population helper now consumes the same complete global plan and cap instead
  of granting one selected town an isolated full-demand budget. Static military
  ambience also detects owner/policy-key changes, recycles unclaimed old roots,
  preserves player claims, resets bounded initialization slots, and repopulates
  through that shared cap.
- Ambient lifecycle rows and unclaimed vehicles are session-only. A player-first
  observation before persistence on every server frame avoids a full ambient-root
  occupancy scan and promotes current live
  player occupancy, rather than distance from spawn, to durable `field_vehicle`
  authority. The pre-capture path repeats the observation and fails closed if a
  promoted root lacks exact durable authority. The shared tracker refreshes
  promotion, restored/adopted field-vehicle, and garage-redeploy transform,
  destruction, and cargo-position state; dead controlled occupants
  and destroyed roots cannot claim. Durable rows retain their saved IDs across
  process restart, exact reverse bindings win every loot/garage target lookup,
  and ambiguous recovery fails closed. Garage redeploy admits a fresh campaign-
  stable ID/root before removing the stored row or spending money and rolls back
  the root, row, cargo, and binding on failure. New-campaign reset preserves only occupied
  live tracked durable roots, normalizes retained loot/field/garage rows to
  `field_vehicle`, copies their vehicle/cargo rows before state replacement, and
  deletes every other bound root once. Save capture/restore drops unclaimed
  ambient rows and cargo and converts a legacy live detached ambient claim to
  that field-vehicle form. Deterministic allocator, lifecycle, settings-
  migration, and save-boundary proof services are complete and wired; Campaign
  Debug, a native server, ten-town/ten-minute soak, native brief enter/exit,
  autosave/restart, destruction, and reset remain open.
- The sealed Schema-65 civilian-consequence source/Workbench layer observes exact ambient
  deaths through a server callback and uses bounded 256-casualty/64-theft queues,
  a combined four-transaction frame cap, and bounded-backoff indefinite retry
  outside that callback. Pending authority defers capture. Successful durable
  promotion by an exact resistance pilot applies one theft receipt keyed by its
  durable vehicle ID; passenger occupancy only protects the transient root.
  Nearby-
  combat policy requires the current combat-presence revision plus a positive
  current-operation or recent-fire count; `HOT` alone has no effect. Canonical-
  town events preserve population, faction support, reputation, wanted heat,
  enemy aggression, and exact strategic receipts while a persisted episode
  envelope drains any older pending receipt before a new edge and preserves
  `episode - lastApplied <= 1`. Physical pedestrians run the bounded
  `Wandering -> Panicked -> Recovering` lifecycle with a separate bounded panic-
  route recovery counter and no hot-path AI reactivation. Minor localities remain panic-
  only where allowed and use session-only de-duplication, never invented
  political facts. The casualty, replay/conflict, attribution, theft, combat,
  minor-locality, malformed, aggression, persistence, and panic-transition proof
  cases are complete and wired. Final stamped normal and all-five Workbench
  checks are clean at 5,802 Game files/11,728 classes with CRC `c0a672b9`,
  `Script validation successful`, zero HST script errors, and zero surviving
  processes. Foundation passes at 717 script-symbol references. Native
  callbacks, movement, profile restart, package, multiplayer, and
  rendered behavior remain open. Commander aid and
  ownership/security-pressure paths also still need runtime proof. Schema 66 now
  implements the first exact enemy-town local-security roster; its native and
  restart behavior remains unverified.
- Runtime and garage vehicle heat/report state for undercover vehicle cover,
  with passenger compromise counts, report expiry, capture/redeploy handoff,
  save-data preservation, and one-button debug proof
- Request-driven force composition for support, mission, garrison, and debug probes, with
  serializable intent, tier, cost, manpower, vehicle-plan, skipped-prefab, and
  failure metadata retained on support, enemy-order, and active-group records
- A schema-52 force/operation authority boundary with durable per-projection results,
  explicit force/projection identity on active groups, exact required-slot
  admission, bounded priority/FIFO scheduling and retention, retry/deadline/
  cancellation handling, dependency-ordered cleanup, Game Master registration
  evidence, once-per-restore reconciliation, and canonical operation records
  with persistent strategic projection for confirmed exact paid infantry QRFs,
  newly planned exact enemy defensive QRFs, and newly started mission convoys
- Bounded accepted-settlement archives that replace eligible full quote,
  manifest, and linked ledger rows only after terminal aggregate proof and all
  physical/queue backlinks are gone. Compact rows preserve issue, confirmation,
  and committed-ledger replay for at least 86,400 campaign seconds; new planning
  fails closed when the shared history bound cannot safely make room. Capacity
  eviction applies full receipt reciprocity to every positive typed player-
  support contract, including exact QRF and Search-and-Destroy, and removes its
  tombstone/terminal-request pair only when replay validity, unique aggregate
  identity, and absence of live backlinks also pass. Historical contract-0 QRF
  keeps its minimal compatibility match; corrupt or quarantined typed pairs
  remain as evidence.
- An engine-facing force-spawn adapter driven by the production coordinator once
  per active-campaign second. Its first exact slice creates one infantry group
  root plus every frozen member slot, records a durable nonterminal
  `READY_FOR_HANDOFF` boundary, finalizes the projection in physical war before
  recording queue success, and prevents older group-population paths from
  duplicating queue-owned projections
- The first exact player-paid support slice: selecting a QRF map target issues
  an immutable two-step server quote, confirmation charges a flat $250 plus one
  HR for every authored catalog member through linked ledger transactions, and
  the accepted one-group manifest is submitted unchanged to SpawnQueue. Failure
  and pre-success cancellation refund both transactions once; recall settles
  eligible HR through the same ledger.
- Support recall now returns a typed acceptance, mutation, terminal,
  disposition, request, and operation result. It is the first production
  visible command whose durable receipt status comes from that result instead
  of presentation wording. Exact full-refund settlement prevalidates both
  linked money and HR transaction identity, state, and deterministic settlement
  replay before refunding either transaction.
- Schema 50 advances each newly confirmed exact paid infantry QRF's versioned
  `OperationRecord`: immutable origin and assignment, mutable tactical target,
  typed duty/engagement/materialization/position/settlement state, stable
  execution links, revision, terminal settlement identity, direct-route cursor,
  strategic position, projection-decision evidence, and deterministic virtual-
  combat clocks. The first consumer can travel while virtual, materialize near a
  living player, fold clear of contact outside a larger radius, preserve exact
  survivor slots, and resolve bounded infantry-only combat against its target's
  abstract garrison. Physical combat contact, vehicles/assets, other operation
  families, and packaged runtime/restart proof remain open.
- Schema 51 makes newly planned infantry-only enemy defensive QRF the first
  exact enemy-order consumer. One distinct same-faction operational source, a
  same-faction defended target under resistance pressure, prepaid frozen roster,
  order, operation, held batch, and active group stay linked through
  strategic outbound travel, proximity materialization/fold, exact casualties,
  once-only defensive pressure, return to origin, and survivor-proportional
  attack/support settlement. Six `enemy_qrf.*` fixtures cover the source
  contract. Existing orders and every other order family remain legacy, and
  packaged movement/return/restart proof is still open.
- Schema 52 makes each newly started convoy mission a version-1 exact mission
  operation. Admission freezes one generated road route, exactly three vehicle
  slots, three linked crew groups, their durable crew-member slots, and at most
  one mission cargo/captive asset assigned to vehicle slot zero. Money and
  supplies require exactly one compatible cargo row, prisoners require exactly
  one compatible captive row, and ammo, armored, and reinforcement convoys
  forbid a separate cargo row. Admission rejects an unsupported role/kind,
  duplicate row, or prefab that is not a loadable mission-asset entity source.
  Captives must be boardable character prefabs with compartment access;
  ordinary payloads must be non-character entities. The convoy
  advances along its persisted route while virtual, materializes as an
  interceptable three-vehicle column near players, folds only when clear of
  contact and player/mission ownership, and resumes from its last authoritative
  route cursor with confirmed crew casualties still retired. A destroyed or
  captured vehicle with living crew becomes a stationary crew-only root: those
  exact survivors fold and rematerialize from their own durable position, while
  the terminal vehicle is never recreated. Member deaths are retained by exact
  frozen slot/entity identity rather than inferred from an aggregate count, so a
  dead early seat cannot respawn in place of a later survivor. Bubble decisions consider every
  separated living/recoverable root rather than only the aggregate convoy
  marker. Arrival and
  settlement now come from route/crew/outcome authority rather than the legacy
  travel timer. Crew elimination does not prematurely close a money, prisoner,
  ammo, armored, or other recovery-dependent mission: unresolved cargo/captive/
  vehicle state remains in an on-station recovery hold that can virtualize and
  rematerialize until its mission-specific outcome is resolved. Unresolved
  intact crewless vehicles can also fold, reappear, and be captured while other
  convoy crews are still fighting; the global recovery hold is not a prerequisite.
  Cargo on a destroyed or captured frozen carrier remains a ground recovery at
  that carrier's durable position; it is never reassigned. Restored
  historical convoy missions remain contract version
  `0` on the prior path. The source boundary is validated; packaged movement,
  intercept, fold/rematerialization, outcome, and restart proof remains open.
  Nine deterministic `mission_convoy.*` assertions cover admission and rollback,
  projection/fold gating, casualty restore, settlement, open/settled/recovery
  restore, aggregate-marker cleanup, and the materialization watchdog in source.
  Their admission/corruption fixtures additionally reject invalid cargo,
  duplicate or foreign authority, invalid seat topology, forged arrival
  receipts, illegal lifecycle pairs, and casualty authority on non-member roots,
  while preserving missionless exact-looking claimants as durable evidence.
  They are not packaged runtime evidence.
- Schema 53 makes each newly queued enemy `PATROL` order a version-1 exact
  enemy-patrol operation. Admission freezes one infantry root and its ordered
  member slots, debits proactive attack resources once, and links one order,
  generated route, operation, held batch, and active group. A persisted route
  cursor owns outbound travel, one closed on-station lap, and the distinct
  return-to-origin leg. The same exact roster moves between virtual and physical
  projection; mapped casualties remain retired across fold, reprojection, and
  restore. Physical contact holds the route clock until clear, preventing
  off-bubble catch-up from skipping the contact window. Return settlement refunds
  only the surviving fraction of the proactive attack debit and is replay-safe.
  Type plus contract-version dispatch keeps exact patrols separate from exact
  defensive QRFs and legacy orders. Historical patrol rows remain contract
  version `0`; malformed current-schema patrol authority is retained under
  quarantine version `-53` and never falls back to legacy or another exact owner.
  Physical movement, fold, save, and campaign-stop settlement now require a
  unique root/member adapter-to-PhysicalWar binding graph. A deleted binding with
  no observed death remains unresolved and cannot become a guessed casualty or
  survivor refund. Quarantine capture waits until both runtime registries are
  empty, then retains the diagnostic graph without refund. Ten
  deterministic `enemy_patrol.*` assertions cover admission, replay/refund,
  route loop/return, queue/roster transfer, contact transition, settlement,
  physical-shaped restore, corruption, dispatch/priority isolation, and marker
  lifecycle.
  These are source fixtures, not packaged gameplay proof.
- Schema 54 makes only newly issued policy-v2 purchased resistance garrisons
  executable exact patrol operations. Each accepted quote freezes one
  non-self-populating infantry group root plus the arbitrary ordered member
  slots actually purchased, then links the manifest to one
  `HST_OPERATION_TYPE_GARRISON_PATROL`, held SpawnQueue batch, local generated
  route, and active-group projection. The roster remains virtual and walks its
  persisted local loop indefinitely until a player enters the materialization
  bubble; physical fold and re-entry retain exact casualties and release only
  survivors. PhysicalWar excludes these groups from every legacy garrison
  activation, composition, patrol, fold, survivor, and cleanup owner. The
  purchase is never refunded: owner change, all members dead, campaign stop,
  setup, or typed spawn/route failure settles one replay-safe
  `exact_garrison_patrol_terminal` receipt and retires the projection. Historical
  policy-v1 purchases, initial-map and enemy
  aggregate garrisons, vehicles, and multi-root forces remain on the legacy
  aggregate path. Schema-54 restore invents no exact authority for those rows;
  malformed current exact-authority graphs retain evidence under quarantine
  version `-54`.
  One operation marker reports location, current owner, patrol role, and durable
  survivors, and the Forces UI distinguishes exact-patrol and legacy infantry.
  Nine deterministic `garrison_patrol.*` assertions cover admission, replay/
  rollback, roster projection, route loop, projection/casualty hold, settlement,
  restore, corruption quarantine, and marker lifecycle. These are source
  fixtures. The stamped Schema-54 tree identifies implementation
  `09a1470a4c27dbef866e8cbdba182a7df65fa027` and passes clean headless Workbench
  Game-module compile/create at 5,760 files/11,560 classes with CRC `c62de929`;
  its normal WorldEditor open remained alive for all ten samples over 20 seconds.
  Those gates provide source/Workbench proof only. Packaged native movement,
  casualty, fold/rematerialization, save/restart, marker rendering, networking,
  and JIP evidence remains open.
- Schema 55 makes only newly started `assassinate_officer` guard infantry an
  exact, route-less mission operation. One empty execution root and its ordered
  catalog members remain a held survivor roster across materialization, mapped
  casualties, fold, and re-entry. It has no generated route or virtual-combat
  clock: while abstract it remains on station at a deterministic offset from the
  objective, and re-entry realizes only durable survivors. The HVT stays
  separate mission-objective/runtime-asset authority and is never a manifest
  member, operation asset, or group backlink. Eliminating every guard settles
  only the guard operation as `DESTROYED`, so the HVT mission can remain active.
  HVT success settles surviving guards `COMPLETED`; mission failure/expiry,
  campaign stop, or setup settles them `CANCELLED`; target-owner change is
  `INVALIDATED`; and coherent spawn/assignment failure is `SPAWN_FAILED`. Every
  path records the fixed terminal receipt once with zero refund or legacy-force
  transfer. Historical officer missions, the other assassination variants, and
  all remaining mission families stay contract `0`. Schema-55 restore invents
  nothing for those rows, accepts compact settled exact graphs, and quarantines
  malformed current authority at `-55` without a legacy fallback, guessed
  casualty, HVT backlink, or refund. Quarantine leaves the HVT mission playable
  and projects a diagnostic instead of substituting legacy guards.
  The existing HVT marker/UI row reports authoritative guard strength; no
  second marker is added. Deterministic fixtures are source evidence only;
  the stamped Schema-55 tree identifies implementation
  `552c2c4ff5ac7608fa248c614480a254769b61a4`, passes the full foundation gate,
  and passes clean Workbench Game validation at 5,763 files/11,570 classes with
  CRC `0ec8950e`; a normal WorldEditor open also remained alive for ten samples
  over 20 seconds. Native entity/adapter/casualty behavior, actual save/restart,
  rendered marker/UI, owner-change, campaign-setup, packaged networking,
  reconnect, and JIP proof remain open for this slice.
- Schema 56 extends that same mission-guard operation type only to guard infantry
  belonging to a newly started `assassinate_traitor` mission. Traitor guards use
  contract version `2`, manifest policy `exact_assassinate_traitor_guard_v1`, and
  quarantine version `-56`; the Schema-55 officer contract remains version `1`
  with `-55` quarantine. The traitor roster is likewise one route-less empty root
  plus exact ordered members, keeps its HVT separate, materializes/folds only
  durable survivors, settles every typed outcome with zero refund, accepts the
  same compact settled shape, and appends strength to the existing HVT marker/UI
  rather than adding a marker. Pre-56 and historical traitor missions,
  `assassinate_specops`, and every other mission family remain contract `0`.
  Migration records `migration_schema56_exact_traitor_guard` without inventing
  authority; malformed current rows record
  `normalization_schema56_exact_traitor_guard_conflict` and remain diagnostic
  under `-56` without fallback or HVT failure. Six focused source-proof
  categories cover admission/isolation, projection lifecycle, settlement,
  restore/migration, quarantine, and marker status. The stamped Schema-56 tree
  identifies implementation `bab5748d817ba434dae701cfbb3b92805d463678`
  and stamp `03a65cd33bee69c6320389803cdd5a2ec8576fb0`
  (`schema56-exact-traitor-guard`), passes the full foundation gate, and passes
  Workbench Game validation at 5,764 files/11,573 classes with CRC `a18c67a5`
  and `Script validation successful`. Its bounded hidden normal WorldEditor open
  stayed alive for all ten samples over 20 seconds, and the latest log had no
  script-error or crash signature. These are source/Workbench gates, not packaged
  behavior proof. Native entities/adapter casualties, real save/restart, rendered
  UI, owner-change, campaign setup, packaged networking, reconnect, and JIP remain
  unclaimed.
- Schema 57 completes the assassination-guard family by opting in only guard
  infantry created for a newly started `assassinate_specops` mission. Spec-ops
  guards use contract `3`, manifest policy
  `exact_assassinate_specops_guard_v1`, intent `assassinate_specops_guard`, and
  quarantine version `-57`. Officer contract `1`/`-55` and traitor contract
  `2`/`-56` remain exact and unchanged. Historical or pre-57 spec-ops missions,
  ordinary `mission_group_*` rows, and every unsupported family remain contract
  `0`. A generic spec-ops composition may propose multiple groups; contract `3`
  deterministically selects the strongest executable group, keeps the stable
  first group on ties, and freezes only that selected catalog roster. Discarded
  groups gain no authority. The new family reuses the same route-less empty-root/member roster,
  separate HVT authority, survivor-only materialize/fold/re-entry lifecycle,
  no-virtual-combat rule, typed zero-refund settlement, compact restore, and
  existing-HVT status. Migration records
  `migration_schema57_exact_specops_guard`; malformed current rows record
  `normalization_schema57_exact_specops_guard_conflict` and remain diagnostic at
  `-57`. Six `specops_guard.*` source-proof categories cover the boundary.
  Schema 57 is stamped at implementation
  `514ebdcbeb1ddfb2a383b19590382517113e2ff6` with build label
  `schema57-exact-specops-guard`. The full foundation gate passes, including
  the Schema-55/56/57 checks. Stamped Workbench Game validation loaded 5,765
  files/11,576 classes with CRC `e0b8578e` and `Script validation successful`;
  the bounded hidden normal WorldEditor open stayed alive for 10/10 samples
  over 20 seconds, and its log had no script-error/crash signature. These are
  source/Workbench gates only. Native entities, adapter casualties, actual
  save/restart, rendered UI, owner change, campaign setup, packaged networking,
  reconnect, and JIP remain open.
- Schema 58 adds a separate exact mission-rescue operation only for newly
  started `rescue_pows`. Contract `1`, policy `exact_rescue_pows_v1`, intent
  `rescue_pows_guard`, and quarantine `-58` own one frozen composite manifest:
  one catalog-backed hostile guard root/member roster plus exactly three
  externally projected captive slots. Captives use typed HELD/FREED/FOLLOWING/
  BOARDING/BOARDED/EXTRACTED/KILLED state with stable escort, carrier, seat,
  casualty, extraction, and projection evidence plus a bounded command
  ledger keyed by request/actor/command/revision. Replays are resolved before
  live proximity/HQ checks, cross-captive or changed-fingerprint reuse fails
  closed, accepted and the bounded recent rejected results remain stable across
  later disposition changes, rejection spam cannot block legal progression,
  and one slot is reserved for terminal extraction. Unbound HELD/FREED
  captives and the guard roster can fold outside the player bubble; custody
  states remain projected, and missing runtime entities never imply death.
  Outside grace a disconnected escort releases custody back to FREED without
  inventing a casualty; during grace disconnect invalidates the frozen custody
  set. Captive context actions use a replicated, fail-closed legality DTO so a
  client or late joiner does not expose simultaneous illegal actions while its
  local coordinator state is absent.
  Guard elimination does not complete the rescue, any observed captive death
  fails it, and exactly three HQ extraction receipts complete it through the
  normal mission reward path. The HQ extraction position is frozen at admission
  and blocks HQ relocation while open. A five-minute expiry grace opens only
  when all three living captives were already in custody, uses the frozen base
  deadline plus 300 seconds, and forbids new claims. Pre-58
  POW missions and `rescue_refugees` remain contract `0`; malformed current
  authority quarantines without invented captives, deaths, extractions, rewards,
  or fallback. Schema 58 is an earlier stamped source/Workbench baseline at
  implementation `f0ba07ff2bc295d12542a3ea34b4c913e99b1869` with build label
  `schema58-exact-rescue-pows`. The full foundation gate passes. Final stamped-
  tree Workbench Game validation loaded 5,770 files/11,594 classes with CRC
  `aa73883a` and `Script validation successful`; the bounded hidden normal
  WorldEditor open stayed responsive for 10/10 samples over 20 seconds with zero
  crash/error matches. These remain source/Workbench gates only. Packaged/native/
  restart/rendered-UI/owner-change/setup/network/reconnect/JIP proof remains
  open.
- Schema 59 replaces the earlier best-effort radio-tower overlap guards with one
  durable radio-site authority per radio zone. One deterministic site/target
  row owns ONLINE, DESTROYED, REBUILDING, or QUARANTINED state; an immutable
  authored prefab/position descriptor distinct from the current projection;
  borrowed-world versus campaign-generated ownership; reciprocal
  mission lock; typed request fingerprint; revision; timestamps; and
  destruction/rebuild receipts. Zone composition and generic mission runtime
  are fenced out for exact/quarantined rows. An authored transmitter is borrowed
  without deletion, ambiguous candidates fail closed before mutation, and a
  missing process handle never means destroyed. The stable site target identity
  is distinct from each mission's unique physical runtime-entity identity.
  Borrowed authored-target destruction requires the reciprocal active
  mission/site lock and revision, the tracked damage manager in DESTROYED state,
  and a projection near the frozen site. Generated-target explosive scoring also
  requires a live matching mission-asset component, a bounded physical
  position, and a unique key in the persisted bounded evidence set. Each exact
  mission asset also freezes the ownership and authored descriptor it admitted
  against, so a later ownership handoff cannot relabel demolition evidence.
  Health/destroy/reset writes are checked after mutation; a failed destroy,
  heal, or rollback quarantines or rejects the transition instead of claiming
  an outcome that the world did not accept. Authored identity uses a tight
  0.75-meter match, while a 12-meter physical-projection tolerance accounts for
  bounded safe-ground placement without weakening the frozen binding. Stop-
  rebuild uses destructible construction equipment, not a duplicate intact
  transmitter, and may be admitted only once
  per tower-destruction epoch; stopping that equipment records the attempt but
  does not manufacture a new tower-destruction epoch. The supported authored
  transmitter has retained multiphase damage behavior; permanent generated
  ONLINE projections disable verbose witness logging and keep nearby-entity
  scans dormant until an exact mission identity is configured. Only resolved
  ONLINE sites emit town radio influence, and zone/mission markers surface the
  exact lifecycle next to the existing location and owner label. A new-campaign
  reset restores the borrowed authored transmitter's health before replacing
  state or fails closed. A streamed-out borrowed target keeps its exact mission
  aggregate dormant in `radio_site_projection_pending` (or preserves
  `radio_site_target_destroyed` after evidence) until the same target returns;
  missing/cross-linked runtime rows quarantine. Generic runtime, composition,
  objective ticking, commander progress, and generic failure settlement cannot
  mutate exact or quarantined radio aggregates. Quarantine fails and cleans a
  corrupt current aggregate while preserving already-terminal historical
  outcome semantics. Newly started `destroy_radio_tower` and
  `dynamic_stop_tower_rebuild` use contract `1`; historical terminal rows stay
  contract `0`, active legacy rows fail closed, and malformed current authority
  quarantines at `-59`. Generated ONLINE restore is accepted only with prior
  destruction and completed-rebuild provenance. The focused proof invokes the
  production admission, durable evidence, and outcome transitions through
  projection-only seams, rejects a direct second rebuild admission, and checks
  linked quarantine cleanup. Source and Workbench gates do not substitute for
  native authored binding, explosives, streaming, real
  restart, rendered UI, packaged networking, reconnect, or JIP evidence.
  The stamped Schema-59 source/Workbench checkpoint identifies implementation
  `37fb5f0ffbc80c4bba3151ba1e5d8be6ffcf8a21` with build label
  `schema59-radio-site-lifecycle`. The full Foundation gate passes. Final
  stamped-tree Workbench Game validation loaded 5,773 files/11,608 classes with
  CRC `96914c26` and `Script validation successful`; the bounded hidden normal
  WorldEditor open stayed alive and responsive for 10/10 samples over 20 seconds
  with no script-compile or crash signature. Its one Steamworks stats-request
  error was nonfatal. Packaged gameplay proof remains independently open.
- Schema 60 is the preceding stamped source/Workbench checkpoint. Its historical
  `HST_BuildInfo`
  records implementation `fdf78493dd15915afe8d53f61a8ad1efd65b5635`, UTC
  `2026-07-11T23:24:55Z`, and label `schema60-exact-search-destroy`; Schema 59
  is the preceding checkpoint. The full Foundation gate passes, including 644
  symbol references. Final stamped Workbench Game validation loaded 5,777 files/
  11,615 classes with CRC `7aa80fc9` and `Game successfully created`. The
  correctly targeted hidden normal WorldEditor stayed alive/responding for
  10/10 samples over 20 seconds with no first-party error or crash signature,
  and `git diff --check` was clean apart from line-ending warnings. Only newly
  quoted and confirmed player
  Search-and-Destroy support enters its separate contract-1 operation type. One
  immutable infantry-only manifest, $350 charge, HR-per-frozen-member ledger,
  held SpawnQueue batch, support request, operation, and active group remain one
  replay-safe aggregate. The direct strategic route continues off-screen;
  near-player projection realizes only durable survivors; fold returns those
  survivors to virtual authority; and deterministic 30-second infantry combat
  updates both frozen friendly slots and the hostile abstract garrison. A group
  folded away from its immutable assignment first travels back virtually. It
  stays on station after the hostile garrison clears until commander recall,
  whose typed exit/settlement path refunds only eligible living HR. Before fold,
  physical recall exit, or campaign-stop retirement, exact player
  support exhaustively reconciles that projection's mapped casualties; any
  surviving projection must then prove one root and exactly one unique live
  adapter/PhysicalWar binding per durable living slot before its runtime root is
  retired. Persistence performs the corresponding exhaustive pass across all
  physical exact infantry, validates each exact-support reciprocal graph and
  live binding cardinality, and refreshes a still-living support group's
  physical position before capture. A failed proof defers the authority transfer
  or checkpoint. Held-batch cancellation snapshots the strategic living roster
  before cleanup so an immediate recall cannot refund a stale full roster.
  Historical Search-and-Destroy requests remain contract `0`; malformed
  current exact claimants quarantine at `-60` without legacy fallback or
  guessed balances. A quarantined group is globally non-operational and absent
  from combat-presence checks. Expired archive capacity can remove a valid
  tombstone/terminal-request pair only after replay, unique-identity, no-live-
  backlink, and full receipt-reciprocity checks; malformed/quarantined pairs are
  retained. The compiled/wired Campaign Debug proof covers valid pair prune plus
  restore and corrupt quarantine retention, but those assertions have not run.
  The same checkpoint removes the overlapping Maiden's Bay town while preserving
  the Logistics Warehouse and conservative frozen-ID save compatibility. A
  no-anchor save is untouched; ambiguous duplicate authorities fail closed;
  mutable generic references canonicalize; and settled, quarantined, malformed,
  or graphless exact typed authority remains frozen. Frozen generated sites and
  routes receive deep canonical clones while keeping their historical rows,
  ordinary lookup resolves the warehouse, and exact validators may use a
  detached old-ID/old-position view with runtime old/canonical equivalence. The
  deterministic in-memory migration proof is compiled and wired into Campaign
  Debug but has not run there, and packaged save/restart proof remains open. It
  also removes known one-second tick multipliers (pure-vehicle count
  oscillation, redundant/no-convoy scans, repeated authority resolution,
  unbounded unresolved-radio queries, and eager expensive debug evidence) and
  disables AI horn behavior at the native wheeled-vehicle base while retaining
  the scoped ambient-driver input clear. These results certify only the stamped
  source/Workbench boundary. No Schema-60 packaged server/client, actual save/
  restart, rendered UI, stutter/horn, or live gameplay behavior proof exists.
- Schema 61 is the sealed marker-only authoritative client-projection foundation
  beneath the sealed Schema-62 ownership checkpoint. Each logical campaign
  marker carries a stable ID, per-record
  revision, last global stream sequence, and retained deletion tombstone under
  one persisted epoch and monotonic watermark. The server publishes bounded,
  hashed snapshot chunks or contiguous deltas through each player-owned request
  bridge, tracks ownership-derived readiness/ACK state, replays retained history
  when it is complete, and falls back to a snapshot for first join, reconnect,
  late join, gap, mismatch, or explicit resync. The client keeps this registry
  independently of the map widget, commits a snapshot atomically only after all
  chunks pass count/hash validation, and applies only contiguous record
  revisions. Campaign native markers are reconciled locally from that registry;
  server-native campaign-marker publication is retired to prevent duplicates.
  One in-flight delta batch, final-packet-only ACK, immediate post-ACK catch-up,
  and a five-second readiness heartbeat cover rapid mutations, incomplete
  snapshots, and lost ACKs without overlapping ranges. Both encoder and decoder
  enforce row/packet/chunk bounds before an ACK wait begins.
  Dynamic player markers remain on their existing replicated-entity path.
  Authored static zone markers bind by exact cached entity name with
  unresolved-only retry instead of a periodic radius search. Each client hides
  an authored descriptor only after the authoritative custom `Location | Owner`
  replacement is live, and restores its prior visibility on failure, so the
  authored mechanics remain without a stacked second icon. Pre-61 derived
  marker rows rebuild without inventing campaign facts, while malformed current
  projection state advances the epoch before rebuild. The compiled deterministic
  source fixtures cover
  snapshot/JIP, ordered create/update/delete, rapid and snapshot-pending
  mutation, final-only multi-packet ACK, lost-ACK recovery, dropped-delta
  resync, reconnect, epoch reset, ACK pruning, malformed/oversize input, and
  migration idempotency. Packaged
  host/two-client equality, reconnect/late join, native widget rendering,
  map-close continuity, and real save/restart remain open; the fixtures have not
  been executed as a Campaign Debug or packaged runtime result.
- Schema 62 is an earlier sealed canonical ownership-transition source/
  Workbench boundary. Every
  location has ownership contract version `1`, a monotonic ownership revision,
  and active/latest receipt backlinks. Military capture, mission capture,
  political support, admin, debug seed, and migration repair now enter one
  request/fingerprint/replay boundary. Supported zone aliases are canonicalized
  before fingerprint and replay comparison. Cause policy remains explicit:
  military and mission capture keep normal retaliation; admin reconciles
  security and notifies without retaliation; debug seed also suppresses
  notification; and
  migration repair preserves security and suppresses both retaliation and
  notification. Admission and current-save normalization enforce those cause
  flags rather than trusting serialized policy. A revision that cannot safely
  advance exactly once is rejected before mutation. Every accepted exact patrol
  manifest must resolve to exactly one
  reciprocal, open, non-quarantined patrol operation; that authority is checked
  again on every pre-owner retry so late or orphaned exact rows fail closed.
  The accepted receipt settles old exact patrol and aggregate security, hostile
  runtime, new-owner security, frozen town-support consequences, owner revision,
  town policy, generated-site and
  facility/logistics derivation, frozen enemy retaliation, economy/outcome,
  strategic/campaign events, marker/client publication, notification, and
  persistence scheduling through an explicit checklist. Retry-capable security
  and support work occurs before the owner changes; a recoverable blocker keeps
  the old owner visible and persists the incomplete receipt for bounded retry.
  Identical replay is a no-op, changed-fingerprint reuse and stale owner/revision
  reject, and malformed current authority quarantines at `-62`.
  Nested political flips caused by a parent capture finish their domain work but
  delegate marker/menu/GM/notification publication to the parent. Later valid
  top-level requests are admitted immediately as pristine durable receipts. They
  return accepted plus needs-retry and remain pre-owner in array order behind
  every earlier unresolved top-level receipt, so no security, support, owner, or
  derived-domain mutation can overtake the active publisher. Exact mission,
  political, admin, and migration intent therefore survives the publication
  fence and restart instead of becoming a one-shot rejection. Rebuilt explicit-
  ID commands reuse frozen preconditions only after semantic identity matches.
  If an earlier parent's exact linked-town support event meets a later pristine
  queued receipt on that town, the support fact commits once while only political threshold
  reconciliation waits for FIFO ownership work to drain; the periodic civilian
  pass then reconciles that threshold without making the receipts wait on each
  other.
  Ordinary marker rebuilds ignore queued pre-owner receipts, but retain the prior
  owner/revision for an owner-applied active receipt or completed unreleased
  child. Projection resolves exact receipt/zone authority first; a retained
  logical marker can only corroborate the resolved owner/revision, never supply
  authority by itself. Unsafe retained rows quarantine the current authority and
  are purged, while unavailable authority reports publication unavailable instead
  of leaking a prior/raw owner. Zone counts, labels, tones, capture rows, and
  income use that same resolver-first contract. Admin capture/progress reports
  distinguish a valid accepted-pending receipt from a true rejection.
  Only the active owner-applied top-level request may authorize one rebuild
  containing itself and all completed children. Marker publication snapshots the
  complete logical marker array plus projection epoch/sequence, stages the new
  graph, validates each exact parent/child receipt-zone-marker chain, releases all
  children, and only then commits client/native publication. Any failure restores
  the exact full snapshot, epoch, and sequence. Setup transitions instead persist
  immutable `m_bSetupProjectionWithoutMarkers` receipt history; activation may
  rebuild current markers, but cannot rewrite that historical mode. Production and the
  deterministic proof use the same logical marker-snapshot builder; the focused
  proof includes staged full-snapshot rollback, resolver fail-close, setup-history
  survival, two-child all-or-nothing release, queued linked-support collision
  across restore, persistence-deadline re-arm, two save/restore boundaries
  showing one political influence event completes exactly once, and a malformed
  current-schema queue-order case. Restore quarantines more than one owner-applied
  incomplete top-level publisher and any owner-applied publisher found behind an
  earlier unresolved top-level receipt. Serialized order is retained only while
  every later unresolved top-level follower remains fully pristine, not merely
  pre-owner. Parent-projection validation still repeats until
  no new quarantine appears, so a quarantined parent reaches every dependent
  child regardless of save-row order. Current-schema normalization also rejects
  a projection child attached to an unrelated parent and duplicate completed
  claims for the same zone and applied revision. Restore recomputes the exact
  sorted support-target set of linked towns plus every town within 1,500 m;
  applied targets must be its ordered retry prefix, and each entry must correlate
  on the same single deterministic ownership-support
  influence row and exact deltas. Counterattack decision/order, stable garrison
  identity/rows, bounded nonblank reason, and campaign/strategic event correlation
  are also fail-closed. Ownership-specific strategic events record only exact
  owner, capture-progress, and receipt aggression facts, excluding unrelated
  global deltas accumulated while a receipt was queued or retrying.
  Invalid-owner migration first reconciles restored receipts, then performs a
  sequential five-second repair scan. Accepted or transient repair work remains
  deferred under its durable receipt; only structural contradictions or a
  quarantined top-level authority require manual-repair quarantine. Runtime and
  restore retry preserve the concrete quarantine reason already recorded on the
  receipt and zone rather than replacing it with generic retry text. Ownership
  retry also runs during setup and terminal phases even though campaign elapsed
  time is frozen. Town policy follows that retry before the phase return with the
  same frozen-clock bypass, and frozen-phase political repair suppresses fresh
  retaliation/notification. Major-change scheduling is edge-triggered and
  coalesced to a bounded deadline; repeated gameplay or retry heartbeats cannot
  reset/starve the checkpoint clock, and the first change after a successful
  checkpoint starts a new interval. Transition completion re-arms that process-
  local deadline after final status/backlink mutation even when a restored
  receipt already says persistence was requested, without extending an existing
  due time. Zone marker protocol `2` carries the source
  ownership revision
  separately from the marker's own revision and stream sequence. Completed
  receipts are bounded to 512 rows, retained for at least
  86,400 campaign seconds, and cannot be pruned while latest, incomplete,
  quarantined, awaiting parent publication, or linked to an unresolved enemy
  order. The sealed Foundation gate passes with 670 script-symbol references;
  headless Workbench validation passes at 5,785 files/11,652 classes with CRC
  `22c13a32` and zero script errors; the normal Script Editor open remained
  responsive without a crash. Campaign Debug, packaged save/restart, native
  security, rendered marker, multiplayer, and live-gameplay evidence remains
  open.
- The first exact force-runtime lifecycle slice: handed-off member slots retain
  durable ever-alive/casualty evidence, confirmed dead members detach from the
  native and Game Master group without deleting their corpses, the last death
  retires the exact root/marker, and restart reprojects only durable survivors.
- Request-driven spawn placement for physical support and debug probes, with
  road/dry-ground/vehicle-safe validation, player/active-AI clearance checks,
  and visible placement failure reasons
- Enemy support-spend ledgers for QRF/support damage pressure, same-zone
  cooldowns, max defense spend caps, survivor refunds, reportable denial
  reasons, and separated proactive attack versus reactive support spending.
  The exact enemy defensive QRF adds a deterministic full admission-failure or
  survivor-proportional post-commit settlement identity without changing other
  order refund policies.
- Civilian town support plus undercover eligibility, request/application,
  detection, police/roadblock scan, compromise, and clear-state enforcement
- Commander-facing no-admin actions for initial HQ selection, random mission
  start, objective/runtime inspection, FIA supply requests, support
  cancellation, civilian aid, support reports, garage/build reports,
  vehicle-cargo reports, loadout-editor status/application, generated content
  reports, persistence status, HQ threat reports, marker audits,
  balance/pacing reports, campaign-end reports, and undercover status/checks
- Phase 0/1 foundation and mission diagnostics are complete: the alpha command
  menu exposes foundation status, explicit checkpoint reporting, active mission
  inspection, selected mission inspection, and null-safe runtime mission fields
- Phase 2 convoy runtime diagnostics are complete: the Missions tab exposes a
  convoy runtime report with vehicle assets, active convoy groups, crew counts,
  travel distance, fallback mode, and explicit movement/spawn failure reasons
- Broad-alpha UI/report polish exposes marker status/detail/audit reports,
  command coverage smoke paths, clear failed-action text, HQ threat/Defend
  Petros reports, enemy order and physical-response reports, support
  ETA/status reports, balance/pacing diagnostics, and campaign-end summaries
- A packaged schema-49 check verified that the restored config metadata brings
  back normal stock HUD and Game Master access. That run also exposed separate
  marker and ambience defects: invalid radio icon entries rendered as giant
  boxes, zone markers lacked location names, the map pointer fell below a
  confirmation dialog, nearby civilian projection was coupled to hostile-zone
  activation, town actors repeated one appearance, traffic defaulted too low,
  drivers held the horn, and radio sites could receive a duplicate tower.
  Later source contains focused repairs, but they still require a
  republished runtime check.
- HQ proximity policy now keeps the 900m radius for hostile operation staging,
  while whole-location activation is excluded only inside that location's
  capture footprint (with a 150m legacy fallback) and composition clearance is
  limited to 150m. This source-only split prevents HQ safety from erasing nearby
  towns and bases while still keeping hostile spawns away from HQ.
- Admin-only campaign debug controls expose one-button smoke, physical, and
  full runtime verification profiles with status, cancel, cleanup, structured
  result artifacts, and bootstrap identity/admin evidence
- Persistent campaign win/loss state with schema-42 end reason, summary,
  elapsed time, strategic control, war level, FIA/enemy zone counts,
  population/support, airfield, outcome-mode, support deployment proof, and
  report generation metadata
- Versioned campaign save-data container that is migrated, tracked through
  `PersistenceSystem`, and flushed before native `SaveGameManager`
  checkpoint requests when saving is possible, with a profile JSON fallback at
  `$profile:h-istasi/HST_CampaignSaveData.json`. Before every real capture,
  persistence synchronously reconciles mapped physical exact-convoy, exact-
  enemy-patrol, exact-garrison-patrol, exact-mission-guard, and exact player-
  support members so a newly dead soldier cannot be serialized as alive between
  physical-war ticks. Physical exact player support additionally requires one
  reciprocal request/operation/batch/group graph, one root plus exactly one
  unique live binding and PhysicalWar member per durable survivor, and a fresh
  physical group position before capture. An open publication transaction,
  materializing exact-infantry handoff, missing/conflicting or aliased mapping,
  invalid live cardinality, unverifiable live position, or nonphysical operation
  retaining member mappings defers the checkpoint before any older tracked state
  is flushed or an engine savepoint is requested; the pending intent is retained
  and retried on the bounded retry cadence.

This is a broad-alpha campaign foundation, not a public alpha. Petros and the
HQ arsenal have live contextual-action prefabs for the alpha menu path, while
the arsenal, garage, and loadout editor remain custom Partisan economy systems
instead of stock/MSAR arsenal behavior. The campaign loop is now connected far
enough to track HQ exposure, queue Defend Petros pressure, resolve support and
enemy orders physically or abstractly, enforce undercover state, publish marker
coverage, and persist won/lost campaign outcomes. The systems are still rough:
cache/tent polish, save/restart soak testing, final surveyed Everon
coordinates, richer AI waypoints, full loadout-editor HST_Dev smoke, garage
progression polish, balance tuning, and mission-specific interactable props
still need to be connected incrementally. The current exact adapter
supports exactly one infantry group root and its exact member slots; vehicle,
asset, and multi-root manifests fail closed as unsupported in the generic
SpawnQueue adapter. The schema-52 convoy consumer has a separate narrowly
owned three-vehicle/three-crew physical-war projection path. Player-paid QRF is
the first support type migrated to this path and, in schema 50, the first force
with persistent strategic movement, materialization hysteresis, exact virtual
roster authority, and bounded virtual combat. Campaign schema 51 adds the first
enemy consumer: newly planned infantry-only defensive QRF orders use one frozen
prepaid manifest, held strategic projection, live-position materialization,
return-to-origin duty, exact survivor-proportional settlement, and one operation
  marker. Existing enemy QRF rows remain contract version zero. Schema 53 adds a
  second exact enemy-order consumer: newly queued patrols use one frozen infantry
  root, a generated-route loop cursor, virtual/physical transfer, contact hold,
  return, and survivor-proportional proactive-attack settlement. Historical
  patrol rows remain contract version zero. Schema 54 adds a fifth exact
  operation consumer only for newly issued policy-v2 purchased resistance
  garrisons. Historical policy-v1 purchases, initial/enemy aggregate garrisons,
  counterattacks, roadblocks, support calls, and other support types remain on
  their prior state paths. Schema 55 adds the sixth exact operation type only
  for guard infantry created with a newly started `assassinate_officer` mission;
  its HVT remains separate. Schema 56 adds a second consumer of that same type
  only for guard infantry created with a newly started `assassinate_traitor`
  mission at contract `2`. Schema 57 adds a third consumer only for guard
  infantry created with a newly started `assassinate_specops` mission at
  contract `3`. Schema 58 adds the seventh explicit operation type for newly
  started `rescue_pows`; historical/pre-opt-in assassination and POW missions,
  `rescue_refugees`, and all other unsupported mission families remain contract
  `0`.
  Newly started convoy missions
  use the schema-52 exact contract; restored historical convoy rows remain
  version zero.
Policy-v2 garrison purchase manifests now carry one executable empty-root group
and arbitrary ordered member slots. They remain in strategic hold as an exact
local patrol and rematerialize only their durable survivors. Legacy garrison
activation still composes historical/initial/enemy aggregate counts rather than
consuming those old purchase records; vehicle and multi-root garrison execution
remain unsupported. Paid-QRF
restore clears process-local IDs and creates one held virtual batch with the
same confirmed casualty tombstones and durable survivor slots. Entering the
materialize-in radius then releases one new root plus only those survivors.
Exact enemy defensive-QRF restore uses the same held-survivor normalization,
clears process-local physical-arrival samples, and retains its immutable route
and prepaid resource-settlement authority. For the player QRF, initial deployment
failure still refunds money and HR; a technical reprojection failure retains the
already-delivered money cost and refunds surviving HR only.
Exact convoy restore discards process-local vehicle/group handles, retains the
route cursor, per-element vehicle state, cargo assignment, and confirmed crew
casualties, and resumes as one virtual operation until a player again enters the
materialization bubble. Current-schema restore accepts casualty tombstones only
on member slots, enumerates legal open duty and materialization/position pairs,
and retains missionless or partially unlinked exact-looking rows as quarantine
  evidence rather than deleting them through generic cleanup. General lifecycle
  authority beyond the two exact infantry-QRF consumers, the exact player
  Search-and-Destroy consumer, the exact enemy-patrol, the exact purchased-
  garrison patrol, the three exact assassination-mission guard families, the
  narrow exact mission-convoy consumer, the exact `rescue_pows` guard-plus-
  captive consumer, and the exact enemy-town local-security consumer remains
  open. Normal spawn
acquisition runs once per active-campaign second. During setup or after a won/
lost outcome, the coordinator cancels every nonterminal batch and drains its
cleanup with a monotonic runtime-only clock without advancing campaign elapsed
time. A batch whose exact slots are all verified remains durably
`READY_FOR_HANDOFF` until physical-war finalization succeeds; only then does the
queue record `SUCCEEDED`. Restoring pending, ready, or previously physical state
clears process-local evidence and returns the operation to the single held
virtual projection instead of treating interrupted handoff as success or
respawning immediately. The focused HST_Dev proofs are implemented, but they are
not runtime evidence until a fresh isolated run executes them.

## Current Delivery Priorities

The implementation blueprint's Campaign Runtime Integrity sequence controls
current work. Feature breadth already exists; the immediate goal is to make its
authority, runtime projection, persistence, and client evidence trustworthy:

The current sealed Campaign Schema 67/runtime-settings Schema 24 source
checkpoint is the first Blueprint Phase 9 dependency: one durable, replay-safe
enemy strategic resource and aggression authority shared by both enemy roles.
It identifies implementation `2798cb20b824ed74419ab6dc9bdce03f18ef71df`,
UTC `2026-07-12T23:46:02Z`, and label
`schema67-settings24-enemy-strategic-resource-authority`; Foundation passes at
736 script-symbol references. Final stamped normal log
`logs_2026-07-12_19-52-14` and all-five log
`logs_2026-07-12_19-52-36` both compile 5,809 Game files/11,751 classes with CRC
`a353fa0d`; all-five reports `Script validation successful` for WORKBENCH, PC,
XBOX, PS4, and PS5, with zero HST script errors and zero surviving Workbench
processes. This source/Workbench seal does not supersede the open runtime-
certification obligation for Blueprint Phase 8.

The immediately preceding sealed source/Workbench tree is Campaign Schema 66/runtime-settings Schema 24.
It layers exact enemy-town local-security patrol authority and protected,
self-healing campaign-marker ownership onto the sealed Schema-65 civilian-
consequence checkpoint described above. It identifies implementation
`a7031797e67d99a99a066038cd8fa39efc03cff1`, UTC
`2026-07-12T20:28:33Z`, and label
`schema66-settings24-local-security-marker-integrity`. Foundation passes at 729
script-symbol references, and final normal/all-five Workbench checks pass at
5,806 Game files/11,740 classes with CRC `ec860be7`. Native, profile-I/O,
packaged, multiplayer, marker-tamper, and soak evidence remain open.

The previous sealed tree is Campaign Schema 65/runtime-settings Schema 24 at
implementation `609add9eeadf73816764c497178e2d35081307d1` and label
`schema65-settings24-civilian-consequence-authority`. Its final stamped normal
and all-five Workbench checks are clean at 5,802 Game files/11,728 classes with
CRC `c0a672b9`, and Foundation passes at 717 script-symbol references.

The earlier sealed tree is the Campaign Schema 64/runtime-settings Schema 24
ambient-runtime checkpoint. It identifies implementation
`6afadc7c13681b78171939a740862e52328beffd`, UTC
`2026-07-12T15:57:55Z`, and label
`schema64-settings24-ambient-runtime-authority`. Foundation passes at 711
references. Normal Workbench compilation and all-five-configuration validation
pass at 5,799 files/11,718 classes with CRC `bb083672`, zero HST script errors,
and zero surviving Workbench processes. Those checks are source/compile evidence,
not Campaign Debug or native runtime proof.

Schema 64/runtime-settings Schema 23 is the preceding sealed source/Workbench tree.
It canonicalizes curated-town support/population, strict political hysteresis,
contact discovery, and Map/War political projection while retaining Schema-62
ownership receipts as the only owner mutation path. Its Foundation and
Workbench evidence remains recorded above. Schema 63 remains an earlier sealed
source/Workbench checkpoint; it centralizes crew-aware combat presence, zone
heat, conservative restore, and render activation/deactivation hysteresis.
Schema 62 is an earlier sealed canonical-ownership checkpoint and Schema 61
the marker-projection foundation beneath it.
Schema 62 centralizes ownership mutations and adds
source-revision correlation to the existing marker stream; it does not certify
packaged multiplayer convergence and does not replicate the full command menu,
tasks, notifications, or dynamic player markers. Packaged schema-50 through
schema-62 certification remains independently open. Static or Workbench
validation does not certify native entities, actual restart, rendered UI,
networking, reconnect, or JIP.

1. Publish and runtime-check the sealed Schema-67/settings-24 source/Workbench
   identity. Require package, server, client, log, and artifact identity to
   agree; do not substitute the immediately preceding Schema-66 checkpoint.
2. Implement persisted per-enemy planning cadence, deterministic candidate
   ordering, and a frozen target/source/order/cost decision fingerprint as the
   immediate next Blueprint Phase 9 slice on top of the sealed Schema-67
   resource authority.
3. In the eventual published check, prove military, mission, political, admin, and
   migration ownership routing; one owner-revision increment; pre-owner retry;
   exact-patrol settlement; post-liberation security; counterattack/economy/event
   consequences; save/restart resume; and marker source-revision correlation.
   Also prove one canonical town record per curated town, separate occupier and
   invader support, the population-scaling goldens, strict equality boundaries,
   no direct political owner bypass, pre-64 migration/current quarantine, and
   contacted-town/territory ordering.
   Also prove the sealed Schema-61 host/client marker registry and earlier marker,
   map-dialog, radio-site, and civilian repairs. Require valid-sized marker
   icons, `Location | Owner` labels, a
   visible pointer over the support confirmation dialog, one authored radio
   tower per existing site, and correct destroy-target binding. The already
   restored stock HUD and Game Master access must remain intact.
4. Prove civilian projection in a fresh packaged run: zero unregistered group-
   member RPCs, varied concrete appearances, the configurable daytime/low-heat
   true-town traffic target (default five) when population and global budgets permit,
   fair service across ten simultaneously eligible towns for ten minutes, two
   pedestrians at the known minor woodland locality, no stuck horns, and actual
   distance-over-time movement or bounded recovery/recycle. Figari and Morton must project
   civilians and eligible military garrisons near a player; Maiden's Bay must
   show only the Logistics Warehouse; and the separate 900 m hostile-operation
   staging clearance must not erase either location. Confirm that the observed
   once-per-second stutter and continuous AI horns are gone. Also prove real
   save/restart, short player-use vehicle claims without loss or duplication,
   exact server casualty queue/drain attribution, civilian theft only after
   durable promotion by an exact resistance pilot, and at most one canonical-
   town nearby-combat consequence per danger episode. Passengers must protect a
   live ambient root without promoting it or creating theft.
   Demonstrate that `HOT` alone is inert, logical population/support/heat/
   aggression survives with no rendered actors, and pedestrians complete
   `Wandering -> Panicked -> Recovering`. Include the panic-only minor-locality
   restart limitation explicitly. Commander aid and ownership/security-pressure
   paths also need runtime proof. In the same boundary, prove the Schema-66
   enemy-town patrol admits one exact roster, preserves casualties through fold/
   restore without refill, applies destruction loss once, refuses same-epoch
   resurrection, rearms only from a newer owner revision or later positive
   police event, and gives resistance towns zero automatic police/roadblocks.
   Source inspection alone does not close any of those runtime gates.
5. Execute the isolated `HST_Dev` completion/cancellation/restart boundary and
   replace the historical Full Campaign Debug artifact with corrected evidence.
6. Runtime-prove exact paid-QRF creation and the schema-50 operation path:
   strategic travel from the direct-route cursor, bounded catch-up, proximity
   materialization/fold hysteresis, exact casualty/survivor transfer, on-station
   virtual combat, recall/settlement, archive replay, and once-only accounting
   across save/restart.
7. Runtime-prove the schema-51 exact infantry-only enemy defensive QRF: one
   prepaid frozen roster, no duplicate legacy response, strategic outbound and
   return travel, materialization/fold hysteresis, exact casualties, two-sample
   physical arrival, once-only defensive pressure, proportional survivor
   settlement, marker movement/cleanup, and save/restart replay.
8. Runtime-prove the schema-52 exact mission convoy: one frozen generated road
   route, exactly three linked vehicles and three crew groups, cargo/captive
   assignment to vehicle zero, virtual travel without timer arrival,
   materialization with 3/3 seated living drivers, physical interception,
   contact-to-clear transition followed by casualty-preserving fold/
   rematerialization, partial crewless-vehicle reprojection/capture, non-suffix
   member casualties, cargo-only terminal-carrier recovery, detached player-bound
   cargo fold, duplicate-free garage handoff, two-sample physical arrival,
   once-only mission outcome/settlement, aggregate current/destination marker
   cleanup, and save/restart. Then prove the repaired
   support route-truth boundary through actual movement, two-sample arrival,
   recall exit, and bounded transactional waypoint reissue in scoped disposable
   profiles. In the same disposable boundary, reproduce the crewless mixed-QRF
   case and prove one terminal transition, zero capture/marker pressure, one
   neutral salvage detachment, no duplicate vehicle, and no survivor
   resurrection after restart.
9. Runtime-prove the Schema-60 exact infantry-only player Search-and-Destroy
   operation: immutable quote/manifest/ledger identity, $350 plus exact roster
   HR, no vehicle/asset/multi-root substitution, direct-route travel, virtual-
   to-physical-to-virtual survivor continuity, mapped casualties, off-screen
   combat, virtual return to assignment after a displaced fold, commander
   recall, living-HR settlement, archive replay, contract-0 legacy isolation,
   `-60` quarantine, safe paired archive-capacity eviction, corrupt-pair
   retention, and real save/restart. Require live adapter-observed
   casualties, cardinality-checked root retirement during fold, and the physical
   recall-exit path; the deterministic queue casualty/fold fixture is source
   bookkeeping evidence only. Clearing hostile infantry must leave the group on
   station until recalled.
10. Runtime-prove the Schema-61 marker-only projection with one host, two clients,
   reconnect, and late join. Require equal epoch/watermark/registry hash after
   initial snapshot, ordered create/update/delete, a forced gap/resync, map
   close/reopen, and real save/restart; also require clean client-local native
   marker cleanup and no duplicate server-native campaign markers. Dynamic
   player markers remain a separate existing path.
11. Runtime-prove the schema-53 exact newly queued enemy-patrol slice: one frozen
   infantry roster, once-only proactive attack debit, outbound virtual travel,
   materialization/fold with mapped casualties, physical contact hold, one
   closed patrol lap, return, survivor-proportional refund, marker cleanup, and
   save/restart. Historical patrols must remain contract version `0`.
12. Runtime-prove the schema-54 exact purchased-garrison patrol: a newly issued
   policy-v2 resistance purchase must hold one exact arbitrary member roster,
   loop locally while virtual, materialize its empty root plus living slots,
   retain mapped casualties across fold/re-entry, publish and clean up its
   marker, and settle without a refund on owner change, all-dead, or campaign
   stop. Save/restart and late join must preserve the same roster and cursor.
   Historical policy-v1, initial-map, enemy aggregate, vehicle, and multi-root
   garrisons must remain isolated on their legacy paths.
13. Runtime-prove the schema-55 exact officer-assassination guard: only a newly
    started `assassinate_officer` mission may admit one route-less empty-root/
    member roster. Prove native materialization, mapped casualties, fold/re-entry,
    all-guards-dead independence from the HVT objective, every typed zero-refund
    terminal outcome, `-55` quarantine without fallback, compact settlement,
    existing-HVT marker/UI status, save/restart, owner change, campaign setup,
    reconnect, and JIP. Historical officer missions, other assassination
    variants, and every other mission family must remain contract `0`.
14. Runtime-prove the schema-56 exact traitor-assassination guard: only a newly
    started `assassinate_traitor` mission may use contract `2` and
    `exact_assassinate_traitor_guard_v1`. Prove the same route-less exact roster,
    HVT separation, survivor projection/fold, typed zero-refund outcomes, compact
    restore, existing-HVT status, and `-56` quarantine boundary without changing
    the Schema-55 officer contract. Cover native entities/adapter casualties,
    real save/restart, rendered UI, owner-change, setup, packaged networking,
    reconnect, and JIP. Pre-56 traitor missions remain contract `0`, and the
    separately opted Schema-57 spec-ops path must not alter traitor contract `2`.
15. Runtime-prove the schema-57 exact spec-ops-assassination guard: only a newly
    started `assassinate_specops` mission may use contract `3`, policy
    `exact_assassinate_specops_guard_v1`, intent `assassinate_specops_guard`, and
    `-57` quarantine. Prove the same route-less exact roster, HVT separation,
    survivor materialize/fold/re-entry, typed zero-refund outcomes, compact
    restore, existing-HVT status, and no virtual combat while preserving officer
    contract `1` and traitor contract `2`. Historical/pre-57 spec-ops, ordinary
    `mission_group_*` rows, rescue missions, and unsupported families must remain
    contract `0`. Cover every packaged/native/restart/UI/network gate still open.
16. Runtime-prove the schema-58 exact POW rescue: only newly started
    `rescue_pows` may use mission-rescue contract `1`, policy
    `exact_rescue_pows_v1`, intent `rescue_pows_guard`, and `-58` quarantine.
    Prove one exact guard roster plus three captive identities, rendered action
    legality, natural boarding/seat evidence, fold/re-entry, casualty failure,
    three-receipt HQ success, custody-only grace, actual save/restart, owner
    change, campaign setup, packaged networking, reconnect, and JIP. Historical
    POWs, `rescue_refugees`, and unsupported rescue families must remain contract
    `0`.
17. Runtime-prove the sealed Schema-63 combat-presence boundary: conscious
    registered infantry, one count per operational occupied armed mobile or
    static platform, cargo and empty-vehicle exclusion, exact virtual survivor
    continuity, shared capture/mission/HQ/civilian/enemy-strategy consumers,
    30-second `HOT -> COOLING -> COLD` timing, conservative restore, and distinct
    activation/deactivation radii. Then runtime-prove the sealed Schema-64
    town-influence boundary: one canonical record, support scaling, strict flip
    hysteresis, all-cause ownership delegation, contact discovery, complete
    deterministic Resistance Territory, save migration/quarantine, due-expiry
    cost, and legacy-field projection only. Broader encounter and facility
    consequences remain later Blueprint Phase-7 work.

The schema-50 player exact-QRF projection slice, schema-51 enemy defensive-QRF
slice, schema-52 exact mission-convoy slice, schema-53 exact enemy-patrol slice,
schema-54 exact purchased-garrison patrol slice, and schema-55 exact officer-
mission guard slice define six explicit operation types. Schema 56 adds the
traitor guard as a seventh explicit family consumer of the mission-guard type,
using its separate contract version and policy. Schema 57 adds the spec-ops
guard as an eighth explicit family consumer without adding an operation type.
Schema 58 adds mission rescue as a seventh explicit operation type and a ninth
exact family consumer, limited to newly started `rescue_pows`.
Schema 60 adds player Search-and-Destroy as an eighth explicit operation type
and a tenth exact family consumer. The infantry-QRF and Search-and-Destroy
virtual routes use a conservative direct
campaign cursor, materialization uses separate in/out distances, and the frozen
manifest slots remain the living/dead roster across fold and restore. Player
virtual combat is deliberately limited to on-station exact infantry QRF and
Search-and-Destroy operations against abstract target-garrison infantry. Search-
and-Destroy remains on station after hostile clearance until commander recall;
the enemy defensive policy instead applies
bounded capture-pressure relief once, returns to origin, and settles surviving
resources. The convoy instead advances a persisted generated road-route cursor
at convoy speed, owns three durable vehicle/crew elements, projects physically
only near players, and settles through existing convoy mission outcomes. The
patrol uses its generated route as a persisted outbound/closed-loop/return
cursor, holds route progress during physical contact, and settles the surviving
  proactive-attack fraction on return. The purchased-garrison patrol instead
  remains assigned to its zone, loops locally without a terminal lap count, and
  keeps its paid roster as the sole virtual/physical survivor authority with no
  refund path. All three exact assassination guards remain route-less and on station;
  each held exact roster virtualizes only observed survivor state, while its
  separate HVT keeps mission outcome authority. The convoy does not yet simulate off-screen
combat; virtual convoy casualties change only
from previously observed physical state. This does not complete the broader
operations milestone: generalized live-contact authority, terrain and
  ammunition effects, broad legacy supports, historical/initial/enemy aggregate
  garrisons, garrison vehicles and multi-root forces, other mission forces,
  other enemy orders, historical patrols, and full campaign/menu/task client
  projection remain future slices. Schema 61 implements only marker projection,
  and Schema 62 adds canonical location ownership without widening an operation
  contract. Schema 63 likewise adds no force family; it gives existing force
  projections one shared crew-aware combat-presence/heat boundary. Sealed
  Schema 64 also adds no force family; it canonicalizes town political state and
  its Map/War projection. Sealed Schema 65 source/Workbench adds civilian consequence and panic
  authority without widening any force-operation contract. The
  assassination-guard family is exhausted after Schema 57;
  Schema 58 implements the first rescue vertical only. Schema 59 separately
  implements the exact radio-site lifecycle. Schema 60 adds only the new player
  Search-and-Destroy force consumer; further rescue and unsupported mission/
  support families still require their own explicit cutovers.

The last published schema-49 server/client check is runtime evidence that stock
HUD, Game Master, map markers, and civilian traffic initialize again. It also
records the marker, cursor, radio, classification, appearance, horn, and
military/civilian activation defects, not proof of later source repairs. A newer
user server check additionally observed a pronounced once-per-second stutter,
continuous AI horns, and overlapping Maiden's Bay town/warehouse markers. Those
observations are the runtime baseline for the Schema-60 performance, horn, and
location fixes. Schema 61 remains the preceding sealed marker-projection
foundation at implementation `27672e67ce4285810f313130293df1ac917c9bdf`, UTC
`2026-07-12T01:02:39Z`, label `schema61-authoritative-marker-projection`,
Foundation 655, and Workbench CRC `df41a779` at 5,782 files/11,631 classes.
Schema 62 is an earlier sealed source/Workbench checkpoint at implementation
`7c93e0a485bcabe5a364c0b0cfeca235accb50f7`, UTC
`2026-07-12T06:11:19Z`, and label
`schema62-canonical-ownership-transition`. Foundation passes with 670 script-
symbol references; Workbench validation passes at 5,785 files/11,652 classes
with CRC `22c13a32` and zero script errors. Its normal open remained responsive
without a crash and zero Workbench processes survived. A republished server/
client test is still required before those repairs, either exact-QRF projection
path, or any source-validated

  schema-58 exact POW-rescue/Schema-59 radio-site/Schema-60 exact Search-and-
  Destroy paths, the Schema-61 marker stream, the Schema-62 ownership/source-
  revision extension, or the sealed Schema-63 combat-presence/heat and
render-hysteresis slice can be called runtime-proven. The Schema-63 tree has a
passing Foundation gate plus normal Workbench compile/create and explicit
five-configuration validation evidence and is publishable only under its exact
sealed identity. The late-admin
role-change guard, campaign-debug
isolation, convoy seating, physical support movement/arrival/recall, and restart
boundaries remain open as separate gates.

For documentation authority, `docs/FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md` owns current feature
status and next tasks; `docs/HST_CAMPAIGN_DEBUG_VERIFICATION_AUDIT.md` owns the
latest runtime evidence; `docs/MIGRATIONS.md` owns save-schema history; and the
top CRI sections of `docs/PHASE_PLAN.md` own delivery order. The numbered phase
details remain acceptance/history material and do not override those current
sections.

## Alpha Command Menu

Press `I` in `HST_Dev` or `HST_Everon` to open the Partisan alpha command
menu. The menu is a client widget driven by server-built snapshots and renders
a campaign HQ interface with a resource bar, navigation, campaign
cards, action list, and activity/result feed. The Setup tab displays the
effective server config and lets the commander choose the first HQ hideout
before the campaign enters the active phase. `$profile:h-istasi/HST_Settings.json`
remains the source of truth for defaults that apply to newly created
campaigns, but initial HQ placement is selected through the setup map flow and
the generated runtime settings no longer expose a default hideout id. The file
uses JSON-safe `_comment` fields to explain settings because raw JSON comments
are not supported. The same settings file also controls Partisan's Game Master budget
policy through `features.gameMasterBudgetsEnabled`, which defaults to `false`
so GM placement budgets are disabled automatically on game start.
`features.infiniteStaminaEnabled` defaults to `true`; when enabled, local
player stamina is refilled through the native stamina component and the sprint
exhaustion vignette/blur effect is suppressed.
`features.trackResistanceSupportGroupsOnMap` defaults to `true`; when enabled,
spawned player-requested resistance support groups keep a live map marker until
the group is killed, folded, or despawned.

During initial HQ placement the setup map owns keyboard input; complete HQ
placement first, then `I` opens the command menu and server snapshots add the
Admin tab for configured SteamID64 admins.

- `MenuUp` / `MenuDown`: change selection
- `MenuSelect`: run the selected command
- `MenuBack` or `I`: close the menu

The menu routes through server-authoritative coordinator requests and covers
campaign overview, markers and marker audits, economy, balance/pacing,
campaign-end state, zones, missions, mission runtime, manual checkpoint,
persistence status, income tick, training, first HQ selection, HQ movement, HQ
threat, Defend Petros, FIA recruitment, mission start, random mission
selection, objective progress, support requests/cancellation and ETA/status,
enemy order/physical-response reports, civilian aid, undercover
eligibility/request/check/clear flows, zone capture/activation, arsenal
reporting, vehicle cargo, garage capture/redeploy, nearby loot collection,
loadout editor status/application, generated content reports, HQ asset rebuilds,
command coverage and failed-action smoke reports, roster admin helpers,
campaign reset, one-button campaign debug verification, and small debug
resource awards. Commander support and garrison call-ins use the normal in-game
map for target selection and are disabled when the commander has no map gadget.
Garrison and player-QRF targeting issue exact server quotes; the Forces tab then
shows the frozen count/cost and confirms or cancels only the actor-owned quote
ID through a confirmation dialog.
Multiplayer clients use a player-owned request/RPC component;
the server resolves the caller from ownership instead of trusting a client
provided player ID. Petros opens this same menu path through contextual
interactions, and the visible HQ arsenal is backed by the same server commands
from the Arsenal/Loot tab.

## Admin and Runtime Debug

To grant Partisan admin rights on a local or dedicated server, add the player's
raw 17-digit SteamID64 to `membership.adminIdentityIds` in
`$profile:h-istasi/HST_Settings.json`. Backend UUIDs, BattleEye GUIDs,
`workbench_player_N` aliases, and per-session player IDs are not durable
Partisan admin tokens.

The Admin tab exposes `Run Full Campaign Debug` as a one-button diagnostic
harness. It is not runtime certification by itself. In-process debug profiles
are restricted to `HST_Dev`, run against a cloned campaign state, suspend real
campaign checkpoints, and restore the untouched live state on completion or
cancel. A development-session restart is still required because world entities,
player state, and service caches are outside campaign save data. External,
restart, and soak profiles require a separately managed disposable profile and
launcher instead of starting through the in-process runner. Results are written under
`$profile:h-istasi/debug` as structured JSON, summary text, and state-diff text.
A valid admin grant should be visible in logs as a
`settings SteamID64` runtime grant, and command-menu input diagnostics log the
local `I` key/action path when troubleshooting menu access.

For dedicated server tests, repack/publish the Workbench addon before launching
the dedicated server. Server boot, admin diagnostics, command-menu readiness,
and structured debug artifacts must report the same runtime identity from
`HST_BuildInfo`: full commit SHA, UTC build time, label, campaign schema 66, and
runtime-settings schema. Missing or mismatched identity means the packaged
server/client runtime is stale or mixed, even if the repository is newer.

## Design Rules

- Prefix addon-owned scripts and resources with `HST_`.
- Keep the strategic campaign server-authoritative.
- Use native Reforger persistence and session saves.
- Keep off-screen forces abstract and activate physical AI only around
  players and active objectives.
- Track feature-complete campaign work in `docs/FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md` and keep
  planning docs focused on Partisan behavior, status, gaps, and acceptance
  tests.
- Do not copy source assets from neighboring addons.
- Do not add hidden dependencies.

## Development Scenarios

- `Missions/HST_Everon.conf`: full-island campaign shell
- `Missions/HST_Dev.conf`: compact systems-development shell

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md`,
`docs/HST_CAMPAIGN_DEBUG_VERIFICATION_AUDIT.md`, `docs/PARITY.md`, and
`docs/PHASE_PLAN.md` for the implementation map, feature checklist, runtime
verification audit, and current phase roadmap.

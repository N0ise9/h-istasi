## Release decision

**NO-GO - development alpha.** No release-candidate package is certified.

The retained candidate identity below binds its exact source HEAD, manifest, canonical four-file package index, addon identity, and validation tools. The generator verifies that the candidate source is between the audited gameplay revision and the live checkout HEAD.

## Proof ladder

A pass never inherits upward. `partial` means some scoped evidence exists but the rung is not passed for the enabled campaign.

| Rung | Status | Honest scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static/source/resource contracts | `passed` | Retained Foundation evidence is green inside the immutable candidate build for its exact source HEAD. |
| Enforce compile and configuration | `passed` | All five explicit Workbench targets are retained and green for the candidate source and canonical four-file package build. |
| Deterministic service contracts | `not-run` | The active replacement package has not yet run the five individually named packaged focused service suites. The prior package's 5/5 result is retained only as historical evidence and does not transfer. |
| Native engine-world behavior | `not-run` | The active source-fixed replacement package has not yet run the corrected force-authority canary or a full Campaign Debug profile. The prior package's rejected canary and preliminary red full report remain historical only. |
| Packaged dedicated server | `not-run` | The active replacement candidate is sealed but has not been launched through the standard dedicated-server runtime gate. |
| Multiple clients, reconnect, and JIP | `not-run` | Host, two-client, reconnect, late-join, and packet-disruption convergence are not certified. |
| Fresh-process restart and fault injection | `partial` | Selected journal, shutdown, field-vehicle, exact-QRF, counterattack, and rebuild cuts pass; the arbitrary full campaign graph and fault matrix remain open. |
| Performance and long soak | `not-run` | The reported one-second hitch and long-campaign capacity limits have no current immutable-package soak evidence. |
| Canary release | `blocked` | Blocked by every lower unproven release rung. |
| Stable certification | `blocked` | No current matrix row is certified. |

## Retained evidence

- Foundation: **passed** at 874 references for `0e632ec4f63eab43e8c301d0755f10193d85131f`.
- Workbench: **passed** at 5847 files / 11900 classes / CRC `3a399db1` for `0e632ec4f63eab43e8c301d0755f10193d85131f`.
- Active packaged focused autotests: **not run** for replacement candidate `partisan-rc-0e632ec4f63e-20260719T004133Z`; no prior-package result transfers to this package.
- Active Campaign Debug: **not run** for replacement candidate `partisan-rc-0e632ec4f63e-20260719T004133Z`; the corrected canary follows only after the packaged focused set is accepted.
- Historical packaged focused autotests: **5/5** cases and JUnit **5/0/0/0** tests/failures/errors/skips against prior exact candidate `partisan-rc-b8deddc4b631-20260718T213322Z`. Hard diagnostics are explicitly not free: 11 total = 10 approved stock + 1 approved intentional + 0 unapproved, with 40 envelope files rehashed and zero cleanup/spill residue. Summary: `docs/evidence/focused-autotest/partisan-rc-b8deddc4b631-20260718T213322Z.json` / SHA-256 `8bb36919f0649e0f48fad50305878ec883cf98a0021323ba1442017f1aa113b8`; harness `b3fc1e6f56d9cf8805bac1702a54e0b5284e0043`. This immutable non-certifying result does not attach to the active replacement.
- Focused force-authority profile: **35/35** cases and **87/87** counted conditions for `32727238d74b29905c68e5a80bb5897dfdc783c0`, with `CertificationPassed:false`. This is historical state-only, non-package, non-certifying evidence.
- Historical corrected force-authority canary: **rejected fail-closed** on prior exact candidate `partisan-rc-b8deddc4b631-20260718T213322Z`. The focused proof remained 35/35 assertions and 87/87 counted certification conditions, but the 33-check classifier found 3 hard diagnostics = 2 approved stock + 0 approved intentional + 1 unapproved `virtual-machine-exception`. All 10 envelope files rehashed with zero cleanup/spill residue. Summary: `docs/evidence/campaign-debug/partisan-rc-b8deddc4b631-20260718T213322Z-corrected-canary-20260719T001339Z.json` / SHA-256 `2f9656ecf6e8640f4203e231dfe531d0b5eda017619e4f0d83a3e823e66d6951`; harness `38a094fe223232145801bd60e707adf0c80c13d2`. This rejection does not color the active replacement's not-run rung.
- Historical Full Campaign Debug capture: **preliminary and unaccepted** on prior exact candidate `partisan-rc-b8deddc4b631-20260718T213322Z`: 584 PASS, 49 WARN, 46 FAIL, 7 BLOCKED, and 1 SKIPPED; 5562/5688 required assertions proven, with 112 failed and 14 blocked. Candidate identity, packed mount, artifact stability, cleanup, and envelope rehash were mechanically verified, but the original wrapper missed timestamp-prefixed errors. Its corrected overlay found 3 canary diagnostics with 1 unapproved and 25 full-run diagnostics with 10 unapproved; wrapper-reported success is not acceptance. Summary: `docs/evidence/campaign-debug/partisan-rc-b8deddc4b631-20260718T213322Z.json` / SHA-256 `0198f244322fceae63bc0d345a0fa3330e52af3886c540530189054e425538f9`; capture harness `1bff1890830db08159826f63b550227aa7bb0da3`. This result does not attach to the active replacement.

## Specification coverage

- CE 3.11.1 product contract rows: **24** (development-only 1; legacy 3; missing 2; partial 18).
- Configured/runtime mission rows: **39/39**, all mapped to a product contract row.
- Routed command/action IDs: **177**, exact source/manifest set match and all mapped.
- Concrete contextual action classes: **17**, exact source/manifest set match and all mapped.
- Product specification: `docs/ANTISTASI_CE311_PARITY_MATRIX.md`.

Coverage means the surface is named and classified. It does not mean the behavior is exact or certified.

## Active blockers

| ID | Category | Blocker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STATUS-001` | `AUTH` | The active source-fixed replacement package has passed Foundation and all five Workbench targets, but its packaged focused service set and corrected force-authority canary have not yet run. Dedicated, multiplayer/JIP, restart breadth, performance, and soak remain pending. |
| `STATUS-002` | `TEST` | Run the five packaged focused service suites against the active replacement identity first, then run the corrected force-authority canary only if that scoped gate is accepted. The prior package's 35/35 canary rejection and preliminary full capture remain immutable historical evidence. |
| `STATUS-003` | `UI` | Known command-menu and modal-map defects remain open until source correction plus rendered packaged-client proof. |
| `STATUS-004` | `MOVE` | Natural sustained infantry and convoy travel, identical-waypoint suppression, and measured no-stutter behavior are not proven. |
| `STATUS-005` | `PROJ` | Campaign read-model convergence is not proven with host, two clients, reconnect, JIP, restart, and marker-cap boundaries. |
| `STATUS-006` | `PERF` | The one-second hitch and bounded-history admission cliffs remain unclosed. |
| `STATUS-007` | `MISSION` | Configured mission breadth still exceeds mission-specific CE 3.11.1 behavioral parity and proof. |
| `STATUS-008` | `SEC` | Development proof and destructive diagnostic surfaces have not yet been separated from the release package. |

## Next release-closure step

Run the individually named packaged focused service suites next against active replacement `partisan-rc-0e632ec4f63e-20260719T004133Z`, manifest `docs/evidence/release-candidates/partisan-rc-0e632ec4f63e-20260719T004133Z/candidate.json`, and aggregate package SHA-256 `e5d29458c33aeef9cd2b37476359acc6021fe78cf0fc74513d9a2f69ef0614dc`. If that exact-package set is accepted, run the corrected force-authority canary next; do not transfer the historical candidate's pass or rejection into either gate.

# h-istasi Decision Log

This log records architectural decisions that constrain implementation order.
Entries are append-only; superseded decisions should point to the replacing
entry instead of being silently rewritten.

## CRI-001 - Establish Campaign Authority Before Feature Expansion

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-09

Context: The broad-alpha runtime contains many useful domain services, but their
presence does not prove a uniform authority, replay, transaction, or event
contract. Extending those paths first would multiply direct mutations and make
save/load failures harder to reconcile.

Decision: Establish the schema-42 campaign-authority foundation first. Persist a
monotonic ID sequence, bounded command receipts, resource transactions, and a
bounded campaign event log. Route consumers onto typed, idempotent commands and
the ledger incrementally, beginning with troop training.

Consequences:

- New feature breadth does not outrank closing authority dependencies.
- A migrated command must produce stable IDs, one durable receipt, explicit
  transaction outcomes, and bounded diagnostic events.
- Existing domain paths remain partial until explicitly migrated and certified;
  schema 42 alone is not full runtime certification.

## CRI-002 - Quote An Exact Manifest Before Paid Force Creation

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-09

Context: Charging from requested aggregate counts while later selection or
spawning silently substitutes, omits, or partially creates units breaks resource
integrity and makes refunds ambiguous.

Decision: A paid force operation must first resolve an immutable quote and exact
manifest from authoritative catalogs. The manifest carries stable force and unit
IDs and the complete resource cost. Only after the full quote is valid and
affordable may the ledger reserve that exact cost. Creation is all-or-nothing:
every manifest entry is accepted into authoritative force state, or the
reservation is cancelled and no force is created.

Consequences:

- Support, recruitment, and garrison cost paths must not be declared migrated
  until the quote/manifest contract exists for their force type.
- Physical realization may be deferred or virtualized, but it may not change
  the purchased manifest or silently alter its price.
- Spawn failure affects projection state, not ownership of an already committed
  manifest, unless the operation contract explicitly cancels before commit.

## CRI-003 - Isolate Certification Runs From Campaign Saves

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-09

Context: Full campaign diagnostics deliberately exercise destructive branches,
including terminal outcomes and resource depletion. Running them against a live
campaign can contaminate persisted state and invalidate later evidence.

Decision: Destructive runtime and certification profiles must execute in an
isolated disposable campaign or behind a proven snapshot-and-restore boundary.
Static validation and Workbench compilation may run against the development
workspace, but they do not substitute for isolated runtime certification.

Consequences:

- Do not run a destructive certification suite against a campaign save that a
  player or later test intends to keep.
- In-process profiles fail closed outside the development world. The live state
  is persisted and retained untouched while a deep clone owns the run; complete
  and cancel both restore the original reference and persistence tracking.
- External, restart, and soak workflows require a separately managed disposable
  profile and launcher instead of entering the shared in-process bootstrap.
- Certification evidence must identify its build, scenario, isolation method,
  save/migration boundary, and result.
- If isolation or restoration cannot be proven, the runtime certification gate
  remains open rather than risking persistent state.
- Campaign-state swapping does not restore world/player/service runtime state,
  so the development session must still be restarted after a run.

## CRI-004 - Make Player Garrison Recruitment All-Or-Nothing

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-09
- Settlement-retention consequence superseded by CRI-005 on 2026-07-10.

Context: The quantity chooser previously charged one flat HR after silently
clamping the requested quantity to remaining capacity. That made the displayed
quantity, accepted roster, and charged basis disagree.

Decision: Player-visible garrison recruitment uses an expiring server quote and
an all-or-nothing capacity policy. Each accepted member costs $50 and one HR.
The first action only creates the immutable quote/manifest; a later action
confirms only the quote ID. No partial acceptance is allowed. Existing protected
internal/debug aggregate helpers retain caller-supplied total costs for
compatibility but are not the player purchase authority.

Consequences:

- A request for more members than remaining capacity fails without a manifest,
  debit, or garrison change.
- The exact UI confirmation row comes from the persisted quote, not the original
  quantity button.
- Confirmation creates two linked ledger rows, registers exactly the manifest
  member-count increment, verifies one acceptance-provenance link, and then
  commits. This is purchase-time strategic authority, not yet living-slot or
  physicalization authority.
- Equipment pricing/consumption is intentionally zero in this first policy and
  remains an explicit later extension rather than an implied hidden charge.
- Concurrent open quotes are bounded. Accepted settlement history remains
  durable and un-compacted until a replay-safe archive/tombstone policy exists.

## CRI-005 - Bound Accepted Force-Settlement History Without Losing Replay

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-10

Context: Exact garrison and paid-QRF quotes, manifests, and ledger rows provide
replay safety, but retaining every settled aggregate in full eventually makes
planning history unbounded. Deleting those rows without a replacement would
reopen duplicate issue, confirmation, debit, refund, and conflict handling after
restart.

Decision: Retain accepted rows in full for at least 600 campaign seconds and
while any active-group, enemy-order, or force-spawn backlink remains. A paid QRF
also requires one unique terminal support settlement. Only a provably terminal,
unambiguous aggregate may compact atomically into a persisted replay tombstone.
Tombstones retain issue/confirmation/actor/
operation/manifest/hash/cost/transaction/settlement identity for at least
86,400 campaign seconds, cap at 256 rows, and share a hard 320-row planning
history bound with full quotes. Admission fails closed when protected history
cannot safely make room.

Consequences:

- Issue, confirmation, transaction commit, and conflict replay consult the
  compact archive before any mutation or debit.
- Live or ambiguous backlinks preserve full history; compaction never infers a
  terminal result from missing runtime handles.
- Production queue compaction must receive explicit pins so terminal queue rows
  do not permanently block planning or disappear while still referenced.
- Pre-schema-48 migration retains accepted history in full and creates no
  invented settlement tombstones.
- Runtime archive/restart/capacity evidence remains required before this policy
  is certified beyond static and Workbench validation.

## CRI-006 - Exactify New Player Search-and-Destroy Without Rewriting History

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-11

Context: Player Search-and-Destroy is a moving paid infantry support family that
must continue its mission while outside the player render bubble. Letting the
legacy request infer casualties, respawn a full group, or complete from a timer
would violate the exact force and operation boundaries already established for
paid QRFs.

Decision: Schema 60 opts in only newly quoted and confirmed Search-and-Destroy
requests. One infantry-only catalog manifest, $350 plus HR-per-member ledger,
support request, separately typed operation, held SpawnQueue batch, and active
group remain one reciprocal aggregate. Physical projection is disposable;
frozen slots and the operation cursor are durable. A displaced fold returns to
the immutable assignment virtually, hostile clearance leaves the force on
station, and commander recall owns exit plus eligible living-HR settlement.

Consequences:

- Pre-60 Search-and-Destroy stays contract `0`; migration does not auto-upgrade
  or infer an exact roster, transaction, casualty, or settlement.
- Malformed current exact claimants quarantine at `-60` and cannot fall through
  to legacy execution or receive a guessed balance correction. Quarantined
  groups are globally non-operational and do not satisfy combat-presence checks.
- Vehicles, assets, empty rosters, and multi-root substitution are outside this
  cutover and fail closed.
- Fold, physical recall exit, and campaign-stop retirement first exhaustively
  reconcile the affected projection. A nonzero roster must prove one root plus
  exactly one unique live adapter and PhysicalWar binding per durable survivor;
  failure preserves physical authority instead of guessing a casualty or
  retiring the root.
- Persistence runs the exhaustive exact-infantry reconciliation before capture,
  validates each exact-support reciprocal graph and live binding cardinality,
  and refreshes its physical position. Held-batch cancellation snapshots the
  strategic living roster before cleanup so immediate recall settlement cannot
  use stale pre-casualty strength.
- Expired exact-support archive capacity applies full terminal-receipt
  reciprocity to every positive typed player-support contract, including exact
  QRF, before removing its paired tombstone/request. Replay validity, aggregate
  identity uniqueness, and absence of live backlinks must also pass. Historical
  contract-0 QRF retains minimal compatibility; malformed or quarantined typed
  pairs remain durable evidence.
- Schema 60 is the sealed checkpoint for this historical decision under label
  `schema60-exact-search-destroy`, implementation
  `fdf78493dd15915afe8d53f61a8ad1efd65b5635`, and UTC
  `2026-07-11T23:24:55Z`. Full Foundation passes with 644 symbol references and
  final Workbench Game validation records CRC `7aa80fc9` at 5,777 files/11,615
  classes; Schema 59 is the preceding checkpoint. The stamp does not certify
  packaged server/client, actual restart, rendered UI, stutter/horn, or live
  behavior.
- The compiled/wired Campaign Debug proof also covers valid paired capacity
  prune/restore and corrupt quarantine retention, but none of its Schema-60
  assertions has run. The casualty/fold/immediate-recall case mutates synthetic
  queue slots; it is not live adapter retirement or physical recall-exit
  evidence. Those remain packaged-runtime gates alongside movement/combat, real
  restart, rendered UI, reconnect, and JIP.

## CRI-007 - Retire Duplicate Strategic Locations Without Rewriting Frozen IDs

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-11

Context: Maiden's Bay had two strategic rows a few meters apart: a town and the
Logistics Warehouse. Keeping both creates duplicate markers, civilians,
garrisons, income, and target candidates; blindly renaming historical rows would
instead corrupt frozen operation evidence.

Decision: The Logistics Warehouse is the sole enumerable strategic location.
Fresh defaults and world projection remove the town. Restore cleanup preserves
the warehouse's existing owner/economy, retires duplicate town-only state, and
uses a detached compatibility lookup for frozen old-ID references rather than
reinserting the retired town into the zone registry.

Consequences:

- No anchor means no mutation. Duplicate canonical authorities, or multiple
  legacy authorities without one canonical row, fail closed before rewrites and
  record only an idempotent conflict audit.
- No new resources, owner change, aggregate force transfer, mission outcome, or
  receipt is invented during cleanup. Duplicate ambient/garrison/police
  projections retire without fold-back or manpower credit.
- A save containing only the legacy town converts that row in place; a save
  containing both keeps the warehouse authoritative.
- Mutable generic references canonicalize. Nonzero typed authority remains
  frozen even when settled, quarantined, malformed, or recognizable only from
  an exact group mode/status; generic cleanup must not reinterpret it.
- Exact historical references may resolve a detached old-ID/old-position view
  until settlement, while ordinary mutable lookup resolves the canonical row.
  Runtime admission and duplicate checks treat those IDs as equivalent, but the
  detached view cannot create income, civilians, markers, or new orders.
- Mutable generated sites/routes rekey to the canonical namespace. Frozen
  typed site/route rows stay unchanged and receive deep canonical clones so new
  generation does not depend on rewriting historical identity.
- The deterministic migration fixture is compiled and wired into Campaign
  Debug, but has not been executed there. A source fixture cannot replace a
  packaged pre-update save/restart test.
- A packaged pre-update-save test must prove the duplicate does not return.

## CRI-008 - Project Campaign Markers From One Revisioned Client View

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-11

Context: Server marker-state rebuilds and native marker publication did not give
each client a durable logical registry, global ordering, deletion history, or a
late-join/reconnect convergence contract. Publication counters therefore could
not prove that the host and every client held the same marker view, and sending
both server-native and client-local campaign markers would create duplicate
presentation owners.

Decision: Schema 61 introduces a marker-only authoritative projection stream.
Every logical marker keeps a stable ID, per-record revision, last global stream
sequence, and tombstone. The server publishes bounded, hashed snapshot chunks
or contiguous deltas from one monotonic epoch/sequence, accepts only
ownership-derived readiness and acknowledgements, and falls back to a fresh
snapshot whenever retained history cannot prove continuity. Each client keeps a
widget-independent registry, commits a snapshot only after all chunks pass
count/hash validation, applies deltas only in order, and reconciles native
campaign markers locally from that registry.

Consequences:

- Server-native campaign marker publication is retired. Dynamic player markers
  remain on their existing replicated-entity path and are explicitly outside
  this marker-only protocol.
- Duplicate or already-applied deltas are idempotent; a forward gap, invalid
  revision, epoch mismatch, malformed packet, or hash mismatch cannot partially
  mutate the client registry and instead requires resync.
- Each owner has at most one unacknowledged delta batch. Only its final
  hash-bearing packet is acknowledged and allowed to trigger native
  reconciliation; post-ACK mutations are dispatched immediately. A bounded
  readiness heartbeat confirms lost ACKs or restarts a genuinely incomplete
  in-flight stream without replacing a fresh delta.
- Encoder limits are authoritative too: an oversize row, snapshot, or delta is
  rejected before the session enters an impossible ACK wait.
- First join, late join, reconnect, an unavailable journal range, and explicit
  client recovery all converge through a complete snapshot. Connected-client
  ACK watermarks constrain bounded journal pruning.
- Authored static marker binding uses exact cached entity-name lookup with retry
  only for unresolved bindings and actual-faction verification. A periodic
  radius search is not a legitimate identity or performance boundary.
- The client hides an authored zone descriptor only after its replacement
  custom zone marker is confirmed live, caches that binding, and restores the
  descriptor's prior visibility on replacement failure/removal. The authored
  entity and its mechanics remain intact while duplicate stock/custom icons do
  not.
- Migration may discard and rebuild derived marker rows, but it may not infer a
  zone, owner, mission, force, or outcome. Malformed current projection state
  advances the epoch before rebuild so an old client stream cannot be reused.
- Deterministic stream fixtures and Workbench compilation are source evidence,
  not multiplayer certification. The gate remains open until a packaged host,
  two clients, reconnect, late join, map open/close, native widget rendering,
  and real save/restart all converge on the same epoch, watermark, and registry
  hash.
- The completed source/Workbench checkpoint is implementation
  `27672e67ce4285810f313130293df1ac917c9bdf`, UTC `2026-07-12T01:02:39Z`, label
  `schema61-authoritative-marker-projection`, Foundation 655, and Workbench CRC
  `df41a779` at 5,782 files/11,631 classes; normal hidden WorldEditor remained
  responsive 10/10 over 20 seconds. This does not change the packaged-runtime
  gate.
- This decision does not canonicalize zone ownership mutation. The next source
  slice remains one idempotent ownership-transition service whose complete side
  effects then feed the marker projection as derived output.

## CRI-009 - Separate Combat Presence From Render State And Empty Assets

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-12

Context: Capture, mission contact, HQ threat, civilian safety, and enemy strategy
used related but non-identical active-group tests. A durable survivor-vehicle
count could make an uncrewed vehicle look hostile, while render activation could
stand in for strategic pressure. Repeating full group scans in every consumer
and for every zone would also recreate a visible one-second hot-path multiplier.

Decision: Schema 63 introduces one state-only combat-presence service. Native
physical inspection publishes a short-lived registered-group sample; all domain
consumers query the shared service. A conscious dismounted character contributes
as infantry. An operational occupied armed mobile platform or occupied static
weapon contributes once per platform. Cargo, empty vehicles, destroyed/burning
platforms, immobile mobile platforms, stale samples, and non-operational rows do
not contribute. Eligible virtual projections contribute durable living infantry
but never an abstract vehicle count. Zone heat persists separately as revisioned
`HOT`, `COOLING`, and `COLD` state with a configurable 30-second default cooling
deadline. Render projection independently enters at the activation radius and
exits at the larger deactivation radius.

Consequences:

- Capture, missions, HQ, civilians, enemy commander scoring/defense, and the
  legacy combat-present wrapper must not reintroduce local survivor/vehicle or
  zone-active heuristics. Legacy QRF dispatch requires resistance capture
  progress or a valid live canonical hostile result; invalid authority cannot
  become verified damage, target score, or high-impact support pressure.
- One injected service instance caches eligible contributions per campaign state
  and elapsed second. Same-tick mission, support, order, sampling, and physical-
  projection mutation boundaries explicitly invalidate the cache before later
  consumers rely on it.
- The native sampler keeps an indexed runtime registry and reusable scratch
  arrays; the state-only service caches contribution, authority-gap, and
  zone/radius results. An unresolved spawned-group authority gap invalidates the
  affected result. Legacy QRF arrival resolution treats that authority as
  tri-state: unresolved evidence defers resolution, while only authoritative
  zero pressure or missing/terminal durable group authority may fail the
  response. Capture also requires a living conscious character and does not
  count spectator or Game Master proxies as friendly presence.
- Stable heat and freshness-only sample refreshes do not mark persistence dirty.
  The first clear tick begins cooling once; repeated clear ticks do not extend
  its deadline. MissionRuntime retains a persisted `HOT` guard for the one
  boundary tick before the heat service observes the clear result and begins
  cooling.
- Restore always invalidates native physical samples. Pre-63 and malformed
  current heat become canonical `COLD` without inferring pressure from vehicles,
  markers, render state, or generic group rows; valid current cooling may keep
  its original deadline only when its duration is `1..300`, last-hot is not from
  the future, and the deadline is still strictly in the future.
- Runtime-settings Schema 23 owns
  `capture.combatPresenceCoolingSeconds`, default 30 and normalized to `1..300`.
- Authored zone activation overrides retain the global exit-minus-entry margin,
  with at least 100 metres of physicalization hysteresis. Cold zones with no
  potential hostile contributor skip full result allocation; capture defers
  hostile queries until resistance presence exists; and an unchanged runtime
  topology signature skips the redundant second native sampler/index
  rebuild while still detecting equal-count handle replacement and native group
  membership-count changes.
- Deterministic state fixtures are implementation evidence only. Native seat,
  damage, movement, cache ordering, real serialization/restart, packaged
  runtime, and multiplayer behavior remain open until directly tested.
  The sealed Schema-63 checkpoint identifies implementation
  `85a75c65e9c148a890d8d78b0288ae6483a5ccd9`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T08:22:05Z`, and label `schema63-canonical-combat-presence`.
  Foundation passes at 681 script-symbol references, and a normal Workbench
  Script Editor open compiled/created 5,788 files/11,670 classes with CRC
  `a40056c5`, no HST script errors, and no crash. Explicit validation also passes
  for WORKBENCH, PC, XBOX, PS4, and PS5 with exit code `0`.

## CRI-010 - Canonicalize Town Influence Before Expanding Political Gameplay

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-12

Context: Town political truth was split between signed zone support and a
civilian FIA/occupier pair, while population and modifier aggregates lived on
the civilian row. Several production callers could mutate those fields through
different wrappers, and the per-second civilian tick folded every town across
all influence events. That made faction attribution, migration, flip ownership,
and the reported one-second stutter difficult to reason about. The Map/War tab
also displayed an arbitrary zone subset rather than contacted political truth.

Decision: Schema 64 introduces exactly one revisioned
`HST_TownInfluenceRecord` for each unique curated town. It is the sole owner of
separate FIA/occupier/invader basis-point support, initial/remaining/destroyed
population, contact/activity, event aggregates, and pending political intent.
Legacy zone/civilian support and population fields become projections only.
Typed influence events use the population formula pinned to commit
`6e4226d3863ca8673535386c2fff8b6e08a806c4`, and political ownership uses strict
hysteresis: resistance above `8000` basis points, enemy below `4000`, with
equality neutral. Every flip is submitted to `HST_OwnershipTransitionService`.

Consequences:

- Golden scaling is contractual: raw `+1` at initial populations 100, 25, and
  400 yields `+100`, `+200`, and `+50` basis points. Occupier and invader remain
  distinct even when a legacy signed projection uses the stronger enemy.
- Exact event identity is idempotent and preserves requested/effective deltas,
  population basis, before/after support, before/after population triples, and
  record revisions. Authorized absolute debug seeds set all three support
  targets and the population triple through the same event/replay path without
  rounding or owner-based enemy redirection. Current restore requires a
  continuous population chain and exact final-record match even when unrelated
  revisions fall between events.
  Political callers, mission outcomes, convoy/order effects, radio drift, and
  security pressure cannot write legacy support as truth or publish an owner
  directly.
- Contact requires explicit player, mission, incident, or resistance-activity
  evidence. Global radio/security drift alone does not reveal a town. Zone
  Pressure contains contacted valid towns only, current first and then stable
  FIA-support/name/ID order. Resistance Territory contains the complete
  published resistance-owned non-mission set in deterministic type/name/ID
  order and shares the marker projection's completed-parent publication fence.
- Pre-64 migration gives the legacy signed margin deterministic precedence on
  disagreement, adjusts the civilian pair minimally, records one bounded
  conflict fact, preserves legitimate destroyed population, and never replays
  legacy events. Malformed current authority quarantines at `-64` rather than
  being guessed. Simon's Wood remains ambient-only; the Maiden's Bay Logistics
  Warehouse remains nonpolitical.
- Influence aggregates update at mutation time. Event history is scanned only
  when a canonical record's next expiry is due. Verbose changed active-group
  survivor/count logs are throttled to 30 seconds. Both are source mitigations,
  not evidence that the one-second stutter is fixed.
- The preceding Schema 64/settings-23 checkpoint is sealed at implementation
  `6f3c913eaed66926cce38b2ecafcff94084898a3`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T11:28:41Z`, and label `schema64-canonical-town-influence`.
  Foundation passes at 696 references, and normal/all-five-
  configuration Workbench validation passes at 5,793 files/11,695 classes with
  CRC `36d5b017`, zero HST script errors, and zero surviving Workbench
  processes. Campaign Debug, save/restart, packaged runtime, rendered UI,
  performance, and multiplayer gates remain open.

## CRI-011 - Lease And Admit Ambient Population Under One Global Budget

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-12

Context: Per-town civilian targets could multiply physical actors without a
global ceiling, and spawn-request success was treated too closely to usable
behavior. A requested traffic driver might not occupy the pilot seat, start the
engine, receive a live route, or move; repeated reconciliation could then add
work or leak transient save rows. Distance from spawn also could not distinguish
a player claim from AI movement. These ambiguities made ten-town load, recovery,
persistence, and the reported periodic stutter impossible to certify.

Decision: Keep logical town population authoritative and make every ambient
pedestrian, driver, and vehicle projection disposable. One pure allocator owns a
global actor budget and a nested traffic budget, counts each driver in both,
and distributes constrained demand through pedestrian floors, traffic floors,
and a rotating fair remainder. Allocation priority is leased for at least 120
seconds, while production rotates first reconciliation and may begin at most
four ambient root transactions per global health update. An in-flight root
reserves budget but is admitted as ready only after native behavior
acknowledgement: exact living group membership and a current waypoint for a
pedestrian; exact pilot occupancy, engine-on state, and a current route waypoint
for traffic. Movement health has startup grace, a no-progress deadline, bounded
recovery/backoff, and terminal recycle. Each actor owns an immutable projection
slot within its zone/kind reservation set; recovery keeps that identity and
derives a slot- and attempt-specific route.

Player occupancy is the only ambient-to-durable ownership signal. An occupied
ambient vehicle becomes a `field_vehicle`; movement distance alone never claims
it. Unclaimed ambient rows and linked cargo are excluded from save capture and
restore, and a legacy live detached ambient claim normalizes to the same field-
vehicle form. Campaign-state Schema remains 64 because the ambient lifecycle is
session-only; runtime-settings advances from Schema 23 to 24 for the new global
budgets and health controls.

Observe claims player-first before persistence on every server frame, then
repeat the observation synchronously at every production persistence boundary.
Player-first discovery avoids a full ambient-root occupancy scan, rejects dead
controlled occupants and destroyed roots, and fails the
capture closed when a promoted root lacks exact durable authority. Use one
session-only tracker for ambient promotions, field-vehicle restore/adoption, and
garage redeploy so transform, destruction, and cargo position are current at
capture. Preserve each saved durable ID across process restart; a current
process-local replication ID is not durable identity and cannot rekey a row or
its cargo. Run restore/registration before first-frame claim observation. Exact
registered entity/runtime-ID bindings win; initial recovery may
use only a unique same-prefab root within eight meters and fails closed on
ambiguity. At new-campaign reset, retain only occupied live tracked
`loot_vehicle`, `field_vehicle`, or `garage_redeploy` roots, normalize retained
rows to `field_vehicle`, copy their vehicle/cargo rows before state replacement,
and delete each other bound old-campaign root once. The scoped Campaign Debug
Phase 20 population path must select its allocation from the production global
plan and share the four-root transaction-start cap.

Consequences:

- Five traffic vehicles is the default daytime/low-heat demand target for a true
  town, not a fixed ceiling or a guarantee of five simultaneous cars. The setting
  can raise or lower it; remaining population, war
  level, connected-player budgets, and competing locality demand can reduce the
  allocation.
- Per-locality pedestrian plus driver demand is capped to the unique valid
  concrete appearance pool. Traffic reserves its demand first, pedestrians use
  the remainder, duplicate config entries do not inflate capacity, and selector
  exhaustion returns failure rather than a repeated visible actor.
- Pending and recovering roots consume their reserved capacity without being
  reported as behavior-ready. Failed acknowledgement cannot skip lifecycle
  states; illegal transitions are read-only. A dead driver, destroyed vehicle,
  lost authority, stuck root, or exhausted recovery budget recycles the whole
  transient aggregate rather than changing logical population.
- Immutable per-zone/kind slots prevent a replacement from colliding with an
  existing reservation, and give each recovery attempt a distinct deterministic
  path while preserving actor identity.
- Static military ambience treats owner or policy-key changes as replacement
  boundaries. It recycles unclaimed old roots, promotes player claims, resets
  its bounded initialization slots, and repopulates under the shared four-root
  transaction cap.
- Routine ambient movement, readiness, retry, and cleanup do not dirty campaign
  persistence. Only promotion of an observed player claim reports a durable
  mutation. This closes a source-level periodic dirty-state path but does not
  prove that the visible stutter is gone.
- Promoted vehicle snapshots do not themselves schedule a new save. They ensure
  that a pending autosave or major checkpoint captures the latest live transform,
  destruction, and cargo position; an inexact pre-capture reconciliation defers
  that checkpoint.
- Garage redeploy is one transaction: allocate a fresh campaign-stable vehicle
  ID, register the live root, restore cargo, remove the stored row, and spend.
  Failure rolls back the root, runtime/cargo rows, binding, and stored row rather
  than returning failure after a partial commit.
- Frame-frequency horn clearing walks the bounded ambient actor records directly;
  helper-by-root nested lookup is forbidden on this hot path.
- Pure allocator, lifecycle, settings-migration, and save-boundary proofs are
  compiled and wired into Campaign Debug. The current sealed source/Workbench
  checkpoint identifies implementation
  `6afadc7c13681b78171939a740862e52328beffd`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T15:57:55Z`, and label
  `schema64-settings24-ambient-runtime-authority`. It passes
  Foundation at 711 references and normal/all-five Workbench validation at
  5,799 files/11,718 classes with CRC `bb083672`, zero HST script errors, and
  zero surviving Workbench processes.
- Campaign Debug execution, a native server, ten simultaneously eligible towns
  for ten minutes, native brief enter/exit, autosave/restart, promoted-root
  destruction, new-campaign reset, Campaign Debug Phase 20 production-path execution,
  rendered movement, profiling, multiplayer, and automatic casualty/theft/nearby-
  combat influence and panic/recovery behavior
  remain open gates. Commander aid and ownership/
  security-pressure paths exist in source but need runtime proof; deeper local-
  security behavior remains implementation work.

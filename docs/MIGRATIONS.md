# Campaign Save Migrations

## Current Schema

`HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is currently `48`.

- Schema 48 adds bounded settlement archives for accepted exact-force planning
  history. An accepted garrison purchase or terminal paid QRF remains in full
  quote/manifest/ledger form for at least 600 campaign seconds and cannot compact
  while an active-group, enemy-order, or force-spawn backlink exists. Eligible
  rows compact atomically into one persisted tombstone containing quote,
  operation, actor, manifest-hash, aggregate, cost, refund, and transaction-status
  evidence. Issue, confirmation, and committed-ledger replay consult that compact
  row before any mutation or debit. Tombstones retain a minimum 86,400-second
  replay window, cap at 256 rows, and share a hard 320-row planning-history
  admission bound with full quotes. Pin-aware queue compaction now runs in the
  production coordinator so 128 retained terminal projections cannot deadlock
  later admission or permanently pin a settled manifest. Pre-schema-48 saves
  preserve every accepted row in full and initialize an empty archive; migration
  never invents a terminal settlement.

- The current schema-48 support route-truth repair requires no save-format bump,
  but it does reconcile pre-repair timer-derived states. An unspawned restored
  `support_arrived` row folds when it remains outside the player bubble or waits
  for physicalization inside it. A spawned arrived row without the new request-
  and-group proof provenance receives one current live-distance check, then is
  either stamped as proven or reopened as `support_active`. Spawned
  `support_recall_exited` likewise requires current live exit distance before
  retirement or HR settlement; eligible unspawned abstract recall remains valid.
  A succeeded exact QRF recalled while survivor reprojection is waiting for queue
  capacity now settles its durable survivors without inventing a physical exit,
  and legacy rows already stuck in unspawned `support_recalling` recover through
  the same once-only HR settlement when no root or adapter handles remain.

- Schema 47 adds the first durable exact-force runtime lifecycle for the paid
  infantry QRF path. Each successfully handed-off member slot now preserves
  ever-alive, casualty, retirement, timestamp, and revision evidence. The
  adapter samples authoritative life state before pruning transient handles,
  retires each dead slot idempotently, detaches the corpse from native/Game
  Master group ownership without deleting it, and updates the active group's
  durable living count. Once an ever-populated, spawn-completed roster reaches
  zero, the exact root and marker are retired and the support resolves without
  refunding dead HR or the already-delivered money cost. Successful paid-QRF
  restore clears process-local IDs and requeues one root plus only the durable
  surviving member slots; confirmed casualties remain retired. Reprojection
  failure retains the paid money and refunds only durable survivors. Pre-schema-
  47 successful batches gain one historical handoff plus ever-populated/living
  evidence from their registered slots. Migration never infers a casualty from
  a missing entity or aggregate count.

- Schema 46 adds the first exact player-paid support contract for resistance
  QRFs. Force quotes now persist support request/capability/asset identity,
  support type, ETA, cooldown, and expected war level beside the immutable
  manifest and transaction links. Confirmation reserves and commits the exact
  $250 money cost and one HR per authored catalog member, registers one linked
  support request, and marks the quote accepted last. The request then admits
  the same executable one-group manifest to SpawnQueue; terminal failure or
  cancellation refunds both transactions once, while recall uses the linked HR
  settlement policy. In schema 46, successful terminal projections that could
  not be restored failed closed with a full refund instead of inventing live
  runtime authority. Pre-schema-46 paid player-QRF rows keep their gameplay state and
  balances. Positive stored costs import as historical committed ledger rows
  without creating a quote, manifest, or new debit; stored HR refunds become
  historical partial/full refunds. Conflicting legacy transaction identity is
  preserved and summarized by a bounded migration warning rather than receiving
  an invented refund. Schema 47 supersedes schema 46's temporary full-refund
  fallback for successful paid-QRF restore with survivor-only reprojection.
- Schema 45 adds explicit force and projection identity fields to every active
  physical-group row and makes Game Master/editable-hierarchy verification
  mandatory for new successful spawn slots. Pre-schema-45 active groups derive
  missing IDs only from one spawn batch whose result, manifest, operation, and
  force links
  are conflict-free; ambiguous or missing links remain empty. Stable aggregate
  migration events record derived and unresolved linked rows without creating
  one event per group. Existing terminal spawn history remains historical even
  when it predates the new verification field. Cleanup work is acquired in
  dependency-safe asset, member, vehicle, then group order across bounded work
  waves. Once every exact slot is registered, the batch enters the durable,
  nonterminal `READY_FOR_HANDOFF` state. Physical-war finalization must succeed
  before `CompleteProjectionHandoff` records `SUCCEEDED`. Restoring a ready batch
  clears process-local evidence, advances its generation, and requeues exact
  realization; it never promotes an interrupted handoff to terminal success.
  Existing terminal successes remain historical and are not yet runtime-
  reprojected. Normal acquisition uses active campaign time, while setup and won/
  lost processing cancels nonterminal work and drains cleanup through a monotonic
  runtime-only clock without advancing the persisted campaign elapsed second.
- Schema 44 turns typed force-spawn results into durable, per-projection queue
  records. Each batch carries a unique request ID, immutable manifest-hash
  binding, projection ID, attempt generation, retry/deadline timestamps,
  cancellation intent, and explicit failure evidence. Each slot also preserves
  its spawned prefab and alive verification. Runtime queue limits are 64
  nonterminal batches, 512 nonterminal slots, 64 slots per request, and 128
  terminal rows; terminal compaction requires explicit backlink pins and a
  600-second minimum retention window. These queue bounds did not compact
  accepted quote/manifest/ledger settlement history until schema 48 added a
  separate accepted-aggregate archive.
  Pre-schema-44 nonterminal rows are never resumable, even if a partially
  populated save happens to contain newer identity fields, so migration
  finalizes them as explicit failures and records one migration event instead
  of inventing work. Existing terminal batches remain unchanged as historical
  evidence. A schema-44 nonterminal batch whose nonempty result, request, or
  projection key collides with any other row fails closed and emits one bounded
  normalization record. Campaign state also persists an actual-restore sequence
  and the last queue-reconciled sequence. Coordinator initialization reconciles
  once per actual restore before other authority recovery; nonterminal rows
  clear process-local evidence and advance generation, while terminal status,
  prefab, and verification history remain but entity/native-group IDs are
  cleared rather than reacquired as living authority.
- Schema 43 adds immutable force manifests, exact force quotes, typed spawn
  results, stable garrison IDs, and quote/manifest links on resource
  transactions and force-bearing aggregates. Legacy force counts remain
  unchanged and are explicitly recorded as unverified instead of receiving
  invented member slots, prices, or refunds. New visible garrison recruitment
  uses an expiring all-or-nothing server quote and persists its exact member
  slots and per-member money/HR cost before confirmation.
- Schema 42 adds the campaign authority foundation: a persisted monotonic ID
  sequence, stable operation links, bounded command receipts, resource
  transactions, and bounded campaign transition events. Legacy support,
  enemy-order, and active-group rows receive deterministic operation IDs from
  their existing durable IDs. Legacy resource changes are not retroactively
  invented as transactions. During coordinator initialization, any restored open
  reservation is cancelled and refunded once before normal service ticks; the
  reconciled state is then captured and tracked again.
- Schema 41 extends support request rows with selected roadblock garage vehicle
  id, prefab, display name, and consumed-state fields so established roadblock
  support survives save-data roundtrips with its consumed HQ vehicle evidence.
- Schema 40 adds durable gun shop mission state: generated shop item rows,
  seller/delivery asset ids, seller/delivery positions, purchase totals,
  purchase/delivery notice flags, and delivery runtime timing so purchased
  stock and delivery progress survive save-data copies.
- Schema 39 extends support request rows with player-support HR cost,
  planned infantry count, refunded HR, recall request timing, recall exit
  position, and recall-requested state so support recall/refund behavior
  survives save-data copies and active support rows remain inspectable.
- Schema 38 extends strategic-event rows with vehicle report before/after
  fields so runtime vehicle reports preserve vehicle runtime id, heat
  before/after/delta, reported before/after, and report-expiry deltas across
  save-data roundtrips.
- Schema 37 adds the durable strategic-event ledger so mission success/failure,
  mission-expiry, convoy-outcome, zone-capture, and support-near-HQ consequence
  rows preserve source identity, target zone/faction, applied status,
  before/after owner fields, and money/HR/support/capture/aggression/resource/
  HQ-knowledge deltas across save-data roundtrips.
- Schema 36 adds the selected active-group vehicle prefab so mixed
  infantry/vehicle response groups can respawn the same vehicle choice after a
  save/load roundtrip.
- Schema 35 adds persisted support deployment proof for physicalized support:
  deployment route id, placement type/summary, target/road/HQ distances,
  road resolution, vehicle-safe result, and whether vehicle-safe placement was
  required.
- Schema 34 adds persisted population-outcome metadata for campaign-end state:
  outcome mode, initial/remaining/killed population, FIA-supporting population,
  support percent, and controlled/total airfields.
- Schema 33 adds durable active-group source-link fields and original force
  count fields so support, mission, QRF, and garrison active groups can be
  traced through fold-back, cleanup, refunds, and save-data roundtrips.
- Schema 32 extends durable vehicle heat/report fields to garage vehicles so
  reported vehicle cover state survives capture, virtual storage, redeploy, and
  save-data roundtrips.
- Schema 31 adds durable runtime vehicle heat/report fields so reported
  civilian vehicles, passenger compromises, report expiry, and vehicle-cover
  eligibility remain inspectable across saves.
- Schema 30 adds durable town influence events plus town population and
  influence aggregate fields so aid, civilian casualties, security pressure,
  support-majority flips, and active/expired modifiers remain inspectable
  across saves.
- Schema 29 adds durable enemy support-spend ledgers and enemy-order refund
  stamps so QRF/support cooldowns, recent damage pressure, max-spend denials,
  and survivor fold-back refunds remain inspectable across saves.
- Schema 28 adds durable force-composition metadata to active groups, support
  requests, and enemy orders. Existing saves load with empty composition
  summaries and zero composition counts until the next force-planning event.
- Schema 27 adds a durable display-only player name field so member/commander
  roster UI can show readable player names while backend identity remains the
  authority for permissions and ownership.
- Schema 26 adds durable HQ spawn-point position/prefab fields and backfills
  older deployed HQ saves so the HQ runtime object rebuild can spawn and
  verify a physical respawn marker.
- Phase 24 balance, pacing, and campaign outcomes add durable campaign-end report fields and backfill legacy ended saves.
- Phase 23 UI and marker polish does not require a campaign schema bump because marker audits, command coverage, failed-action text, and menu summaries are derived from existing persisted state.
- Phase 22 HQ threat and Defend Petros add durable HQ threat diagnostics and active defense mission/order/support/group links.
- Phase 21 undercover enforcement and police/roadblocks add durable applied/enforcement state, detection score/source, compromise reason, and police/roadblock scan audit fields.
- Phase 20 civilians, town support, and undercover reports add durable town support values and detailed undercover eligibility reasons.
- Phase 19 support request lifecycle hardening adds durable support-request
  runtime fields while preserving runtime handles as non-persisted data.
- Phase 18 enemy commander physical responses add durable enemy-order
  runtime fields while preserving runtime handles as non-persisted data.
- The current save container captures campaign metadata, elapsed/save/restore
  counters, war resources, campaign-end state, HQ/Petros/cache/arsenal/tent/spawn-point
  fields, HQ threat/Defend Petros state, faction pools, players, zones,
  garrisons, active groups, QRFs, map markers, arsenal items, garage vehicles,
  vehicle cargo, runtime vehicles, saved loadouts, issued loadout items,
  captured emplacements, ammo points, active missions, generated sites/routes,
  mission objectives/runtime entities/assets, support requests, enemy orders,
  enemy support ledgers, civilian state, town influence events, strategic
  events, immutable force manifests, force quotes, typed spawn results,
  undercover state, and campaign tasks.
- `HST_LoadoutEditorSessionState` records are runtime/editor state and are not
  copied into `HST_CampaignSaveData`; durable saved loadouts and issued-item
  ledgers are copied, and personal templates are also written under
  `$profile:h-istasi/loadouts/v2` with loadout file schema `2`.
- Runtime settings are schema `21` and are migrated separately by
  `HST_RuntimeSettingsService`.
- Campaign save data is normally tracked through `PersistenceSystem`; when
  scripted persistence cannot flush, the current same-container data can be
  written to and restored from `$profile:h-istasi/HST_CampaignSaveData.json`.
- Raw `IEntity`, `AIGroup`, waypoint, inventory-operation callback, and other
  runtime handles are not persisted as campaign truth.

## Schema 42

Campaign command authority and resource transaction foundation.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `42`.
- `m_iNextAuthoritySequence` allocates server-owned event and fallback request
  IDs without relying on elapsed time plus array length.
- `HST_CommandReceiptState` stores the request, actor, command, argument,
  typed terminal status, result, aggregate link, and receive/complete time.
- `HST_ResourceTransactionState` stores reservation/commit/refund/cancel
  status, exact amount, refunded amount, operation, command, actor, and stable
  settlement identity.
- `HST_CampaignEventState` records bounded command and resource transitions.
- Support requests, enemy orders, and active groups now carry a stable
  operation ID. Existing rows backfill that ID from their durable source ID.
- The first production ledger consumer is resistance training. Replaying one
  command request or transaction ID cannot spend money or increase training a
  second time.
- Save capture/restore deep-copies receipts, transactions, events, allocator
  state, and operation links. Restored reservations that never reached a
  terminal state are cancelled and refunded before normal campaign ticking.

## Schema 43

Exact force-planning authority foundation.

- `HST_ForceManifestState` freezes operation identity, faction, catalog and
  policy versions, exact ordered member/group/vehicle/asset slots, deterministic
  seed, and exact resource totals behind a stable hash.
- `HST_ForceQuoteState` stores actor, target, context hash, expiry, exact costs,
  all-or-nothing policy, status, and deterministic transaction links.
- `HST_ForceSpawnResultState` and per-slot results can encode queued,
  registered, deferred, retryable/final failure, and cancellation outcomes
  without treating an empty group root as success. Production garrison
  physicalization does not yet write or consume these queue results.
- Visible garrison recruitment first issues an exact server quote. A separate
  confirmation submits only the quote ID, revalidates the frozen context,
  reserves money and HR, registers the exact purchase-time aggregate increment
  plus acceptance provenance, verifies the delta, then commits both ledger rows.
  Restore reconciliation rolls back any `ISSUED` quote found with partial linked
  reservations, commits, or aggregate delivery.
- Schema 43 does not claim a living-slot roster: broad-alpha garrison
  physicalization does not yet consume the frozen member slots. Accepted
  settlement history and typed spawn-result history also await explicit bounded
  archive/retention policy.
- Schema-42 and older garrisons receive deterministic IDs. Existing aggregate
  force counts are preserved without synthetic manifests or retroactive
  accounting, and one bounded migration event records that limitation.

## Schema 44

Durable bounded spawn-queue state foundation.

- Every materialization attempt is keyed by its own spawn request and projection
  IDs. Manifest identity binds immutable input but is not the unique lookup or
  idempotency key because one manifest may be projected more than once.
- A batch persists the manifest hash, attempt generation, last/next attempt and
  update times, deadline, cancellation request, last failure, cleanup-pending
  state, and typed terminal result.
- A slot persists spawning/cleanup-pending states, the prefab actually passed to
  physical creation, its entity/group/projection links, and faction, group,
  projection, seat, and alive verification evidence.
- Save capture and restore deep-copy all queue fields and slot evidence.
- Campaign state persists an actual-restore sequence and the last restore
  sequence reconciled by the spawn queue. Applying a persisted campaign advances
  the actual-restore sequence exactly once before coordinator reconciliation;
  ordinary state normalization and new campaigns leave it at zero.
- Pre-schema-44 terminal success, final-failure, and cancellation batches are
  retained without synthetic request IDs or hashes. Every pre-schema-44 pending,
  deferred, retryable, in-progress, or cleanup-pending batch becomes an explicit
  final failure regardless of any partially populated newer identity fields.
  Every slot in such a batch has stale runtime entity and verification evidence
  cleared; existing final-failure and cancellation status/reason is preserved
  while registered and every other status becomes a final failure. Batch and
  slot migration timestamps are stamped with the exact migration second. One
  migration event records the conversion only when at least one row changed.
- On schema-44 restore, duplicate nonempty result, request, or projection keys
  invalidate every nonterminal batch carrying a conflicting key, including when
  the other key belongs to terminal history. Conflicting nonterminal rows fail
  closed with runtime group/entity evidence cleared; terminal historical rows
  remain unchanged. One stable event row provides bounded normalization evidence.
- Queue retention and active-work limits are enforced by the queue service.
  Migration never deletes valid terminal or settlement evidence merely to meet
  a cap.

## Schema 48

Bounded accepted-settlement history and replay authority.

- Full accepted quote/manifest/transaction rows remain authoritative during a
  600-second minimum window and for the entire lifetime of every force-spawn,
  active-group, or enemy-order backlink.
- Garrison rows compact only after the exact purchase-time increment and its one
  accepted-manifest link are provable. The manifest ID then moves from the
  garrison's growing provenance list into the settlement tombstone; infantry is
  not added, removed, or recomposed.
- Paid-QRF rows compact only when the linked support request is resolved or
  cancelled and no physical/queue backlink remains. The tombstone preserves the
  final money/HR status, refunded amount, and settlement ID.
- Archived issue and confirmation requests reconstruct read-only summary objects
  and return an already-applied result. `ResourceLedgerService.ReserveCost`
  checks archived transaction IDs before `SpendResource`; exact committed replay
  succeeds without a debit, while identity conflicts and already-refunded rows
  fail closed.
- Tombstones are deep-copied by `HST_CampaignSaveData`. The oldest row can leave
  only after the 86,400-second replay window and only when the 256-row tombstone
  cap needs room. New planning fails closed at 320 combined full/tombstone rows
  when protected history cannot make room.
- Schema-47 saves receive the bounded
  `migration_schema48_force_settlement_archive` event and keep all prior accepted
  authority in full form. No quote, transaction, refund, or tombstone is derived
  merely because an old save was loaded.

## Schema 47

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `47`.
- `HST_ForceSpawnSlotResultState` persists lifecycle revision, ever-alive,
  casualty-confirmed, casualty-second, and retirement-reason fields. The new
  terminal slot state `HST_FORCE_SLOT_RETIRED` is valid only for a member that
  was previously alive and has an explicitly confirmed casualty.
- `HST_ForceSpawnResultState` persists successful-handoff, reprojection, and
  lifecycle counters. A technical failure after at least one successful handoff
  is therefore distinguishable from initial deployment failure and cannot
  trigger an invented full refund.
- `HST_ActiveGroupState` persists `everPopulated`, `spawnCompleted`, durable
  living infantry, casualty/elimination seconds, and a lifecycle revision.
- Restore never reacquires an entity by its saved process-local ID. A successful
  paid-QRF batch clears those IDs, retains retired member tombstones, queues a
  new root plus only durable survivors, and records another successful handoff
  after exact verification. If no survivors remain, the support resolves as
  eliminated instead of respawning or refunding casualties.
- Runtime casualty polling accepts death only while the exact slot's entity is
  still present and authoritative life state reports it dead. A deleted or
  missing entity is not itself casualty evidence.
- Pre-schema-47 successful spawn batches receive one historical handoff.
  Registered alive slots receive ever-alive evidence, and uniquely linked
  active groups receive spawn-completed/ever-populated plus a durable living
  count. The bounded `migration_schema47_force_runtime_lifecycle` event records
  the aggregate backfill; no casualty or refund is invented.

## Schema 46

Exact player-paid QRF quote, ledger, executable manifest, and settlement
authority.

- `HST_ForceQuoteState` persists the exact support request, capability, asset
  profile, support type, ETA, cooldown, and quoted war-level context. Save
  capture/restore deep-copies every field.
- Selecting `support_qrf` with a map target issues an expiring quote only. The
  Forces tab exposes separate confirm/cancel actions; confirmation sends only
  the quote ID and the server resolves actor, target, context, catalog, and
  resources again.
- The frozen manifest contains exactly one authored infantry group execution
  root and every explicit ordered member slot. Money is a flat $250 and HR is
  derived from the exact slot count. No prefab-name manpower estimate or
  recomposition participates after issue.
- Confirmation reserves money and HR, registers and verifies one linked support
  request, commits both transactions, and changes the quote to `ACCEPTED` last.
  Replays remain idempotent after queue admission and after terminal refunds.
  Interrupted issued confirmations roll back linked aggregate and transaction
  state during restore before the generic reservation sweep.
- After ETA staging, the support service creates one queue-owned active-group
  projection with stable force/projection/result identities and submits the
  accepted manifest to SpawnQueue. The request is not physicalized until the
  queue reaches `SUCCEEDED` after physical-war handoff.
- Placement/admission/final spawn failure and commander cancellation before
  success refund money and HR once, remove an unhanded active-group projection,
  and let a replacement quote bypass the historical cooldown. Pre-success recall refunds HR only;
  post-success recall settles verified survivors through the HR transaction.
- Setup and terminal campaign frames continue queue cancellation/cleanup and run
  exact-support settlement even though campaign elapsed time is frozen.
- A restored `SUCCEEDED` QRF without a recoverable live projection is removed
  and fully refunded. This is a temporary fail-closed policy; successful runtime
  reprojection and the general living-force/casualty ledger remain open.
- Legacy positive player-QRF cost fields are historical charge evidence only.
  Migration creates linked transaction rows without changing balances and never
  invents a quote or manifest. Ambiguous conflicts remain visible through one
  bounded warning event.

## Schema 45

Active-group projection identity and Game Master registration authority.

- `HST_ActiveGroupState` persists explicit `m_sForceId` and
  `m_sProjectionId` fields beside its operation, manifest, and spawn-result
  links. Save capture and restore deep-copy both fields.
- A pre-schema-45 active group receives missing force/projection IDs only when
  exactly one spawn batch is proven by conflict-free durable identity. A direct
  spawn-result link must agree with any stored manifest and operation links and
  with the group's force identity; without a direct result link, force,
  manifest, and operation must all match. Existing nonempty IDs are never
  overwritten.
- Linked groups with no unique provable batch stay unresolved. One stable event
  records the number of derived rows and one stable event records the number of
  unresolved linked rows, keeping migration evidence bounded.
- New spawn success requires alive, faction, native-group, Game Master,
  projection, and any applicable seat verification. The Game Master result is
  persisted, copied, replay-matched, cleared with nonterminal physical evidence,
  and included in final registered-slot readiness.
- Terminal history from older schemas is preserved without inventing Game
  Master proof. Actual restore still clears only process-local entity/native
  IDs from terminal rows while retaining their historical status, prefab, and
  recorded verification fields.
- Cleanup acquisition walks assets, members, vehicles, and group roots in that
  order. The normal per-tick action cap still applies, and ordering remains
  monotonic across successive cleanup waves.

## Runtime Settings Schema 21

Loot-setting key cleanup.

- `HST_RuntimeSettings.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `21`.
- Generated settings keep `lootSkipUnlockedItems` and
  `vehicleLootSkipUnlockedItems` as the canonical keys.
- Obsolete `lootOnlyLockedItems` and `vehicleLootOnlyLockedItems` aliases are
  no longer generated or read.
- Existing known gameplay values are preserved while the normalized settings
  file is rewritten.

## Runtime Settings Schema 20

Loot unlock defaults.

- `HST_RuntimeSettings.SCHEMA_VERSION` was `20`.
- Area and vehicle loot default to skipping already-unlimited items.
- Explosive and guided-launcher threshold unlocks default to enabled.

## Runtime Settings Schema 19

Ambient civilian traffic and generated settings comments.

- `HST_RuntimeSettings.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `19`.
- Generated settings include JSON-safe `_comment` and `_comment_*` string
  fields that explain nearby settings.
- `civilianDrivingVehicleCountPerTown` controls how many civilian-driven
  ambient traffic vehicles can be active per active town.
- Existing settings migrate by rewriting the generated profile with comments
  and the traffic cap while preserving known gameplay values.

## Schema 41

Roadblock support garage vehicle state.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `41`.
- `HST_SupportRequestState` now stores the selected HQ garage vehicle id,
  vehicle prefab, vehicle display name, and whether the garage vehicle was
  consumed when creating a roadblock support request.
- Existing schema-40 and older support requests load with empty selected
  vehicle metadata and `m_bGarageVehicleConsumed == false`; only new
  player-requested roadblock support rows require and populate those fields.

## Schema 40

Gun shop mission stock and delivery runtime state.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `40`.
- `HST_ActiveMissionState` now stores generated gun shop item rows, seller and
  delivery asset ids, seller and delivery positions, purchase totals,
  delivery notice flags, and delivery start timing.
- Existing schema-39 and older active missions load with empty gun shop state;
  newly generated gun shop missions build their stock from the runtime arsenal
  item catalog and only start delivery after at least one purchase.

## Runtime Settings Schema 18

Generated settings comments.

- `HST_RuntimeSettings.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `18`.
- Generated settings now include JSON-safe `_comment` and `_comment_*` string
  fields that explain nearby settings. The runtime loader ignores these fields
  and still reads only the scalar gameplay keys.
- Existing settings migrate by rewriting the generated profile with comments
  while preserving known gameplay values.

## Runtime Settings Schema 17

Generated settings hideout key removal.

- `HST_RuntimeSettings.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `17`.
- `campaign.defaultHideoutId` is no longer generated or read. Initial HQ
  placement is selected through the setup map flow, so the profile config should
  not imply a separate default hideout source of truth.
- Existing settings migrate by rewriting the generated profile without the
  obsolete hideout key while preserving the remaining scalar settings.

## Runtime Settings Schema 16

Resistance support group marker tracking.

- `HST_RuntimeSettings.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `16`.
- `features.trackResistanceSupportGroupsOnMap` defaults to `true`.
- Existing settings migrate the feature on so spawned player-requested
  resistance support groups keep live map markers until they are terminal or
  despawned.

## Schema 39

Support request HR costs and recall/refund state.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `39`.
- `HST_SupportRequestState` now persists HR cost, planned infantry count,
  refunded HR, recall request timing, recall exit position, and whether recall
  has been requested.
- Existing schema-38 and older support rows load with recall disabled, zero
  refunded HR, and zero HR cost unless force-composition metadata can backfill
  a planned infantry count for inspection.

## Schema 38

Vehicle-report strategic events.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `38`.
- `HST_StrategicEventState` now persists vehicle report fields: vehicle runtime
  id, heat before/after/delta, reported before/after, and report-expiry delta.
- Existing schema-37 and older strategic-event rows load with empty vehicle
  fields; new `vehicle_reported` events append rows when runtime vehicle heat is
  reported.

## Schema 37

Strategic event ledger.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `37`.
- `HST_StrategicEventState` records durable mission outcome, convoy outcome,
  zone-capture, and support-near-HQ consequences with event kind,
  source/mission ids, target zone/faction, applied status, summary,
  before/after owner fields, and deltas for money, HR, town support, capture
  progress, aggression, attack/support resources, and HQ knowledge.
- Existing schema-36 and older saves load with an empty strategic-event ledger;
  new mission success/failure outcomes, mission expiry, convoy outcomes,
  resistance zone captures, and hostile support-near-HQ knowledge changes append
  rows when they are applied.

## Schema 36

Active-group vehicle prefab.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `36`.
- `HST_ActiveGroupState` now persists the selected vehicle prefab for mixed
  infantry/vehicle groups.
- Existing schema-35 and older active groups load with an empty vehicle prefab;
  the runtime can select a valid faction vehicle when it next materializes a
  mixed active group that lacks a stored vehicle prefab.

## Schema 35

Support deployment proof.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `35`.
- `HST_SupportRequestState` now persists the deployment route id, placement
  type, placement summary, target/road/HQ distance meters, road resolution,
  vehicle-safe result, and whether vehicle-safe staging was required.
- Physical support requests now copy their placement proof into save data so a
  support request, linked active group, and folded support resolution can be
  audited after save/load.
- Vehicle-capable support requests require vehicle-safe staging. If vehicle-safe
  staging is specifically unavailable, the support deployment downgrades to
  infantry-only staging instead of failing the whole response.

## Schema 34

Population outcome metadata.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `34`.
- Campaign end state now persists the outcome mode, initial population,
  remaining population, killed population, FIA-supporting population, support
  percent, controlled airfields, and total airfields.
- Population victory is the default outcome mode: enough remaining population
  must support the resistance and all airfields must be controlled.
- Population loss is the default loss mode: killed population greater than one
  third of initial population ends the campaign.
- Existing ended saves backfill the new metadata from civilian town state and
  airfield ownership when possible; older control-based ended saves keep
  `legacy_control` as the persisted outcome mode.
- Runtime settings schema `15` adds `populationOutcomeEnabled`,
  `victoryPopulationSupportPercent`, and `legacyControlVictoryEnabled`.

## Schema 33

Active group source links and baseline force counts.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `33`.
- `HST_ActiveGroupState` now persists source identifiers for mission, support
  request, garrison zone, and QRF ownership, plus original infantry and vehicle
  counts.
- Migration backfills missing original counts from current active-group counts
  and links existing groups from support requests, QRF records, active mission
  guard/convoy group ids, or their zone id as a garrison-source fallback.

## Schema 32

Garage vehicle heat and undercover vehicle-cover handoff state.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `32`.
- `HST_GarageVehicleState` now persists reported state, civilian vehicle-cover
  eligibility, heat value, report timestamps, last report reason/zone, and
  passenger compromise count.
- Runtime-to-garage capture and garage-to-runtime redeploy copy vehicle heat
  metadata through the handoff. Existing schema-31 and older garage vehicles
  backfill civilian-cover eligibility from source faction, source kind, and
  civilian vehicle prefab hints, and start with no reported heat unless a newer
  save already carried it.

## Schema 31

Runtime vehicle heat and undercover vehicle-cover state.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `31`.
- `HST_RuntimeVehicleState` now persists whether a runtime vehicle is reported,
  whether it can provide civilian undercover cover, its heat value, report
  timestamps, last report reason/zone, and passenger compromise count.
- Existing schema-30 and older saves backfill civilian-cover eligibility from
  runtime vehicle faction, runtime kind, and civilian vehicle prefab hints.
  Existing runtime vehicles start with no reported heat unless they were already
  marked hot by newer state.

## Schema 30

Town influence events and population aggregates.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `30`.
- `HST_TownInfluenceEventState` persists event id, zone id, kind, source,
  reason, created/expiry seconds, support/reputation/heat/population/security
  deltas, and whether the event was applied.
- `HST_CivilianZoneState` now persists population remaining/killed, influence
  event counts, active/expired modifier counts, and the latest influence event
  metadata.
- Existing schema-29 and older saves backfill town population from civilian
  presence and mark legacy influence summaries from the last incident/security
  fields. Existing saves start with no influence event rows until the next
  town-support event is registered.

## Schema 29

Enemy support-spend ledgers and refunds.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `29`.
- `HST_EnemySupportLedgerState` persists per-faction/per-zone recent damage
  score, last damage time, attack/support spend, last spend time, same-zone
  cooldown, refund totals, and the latest decision reason.
- `HST_EnemyOrderState` now persists attack/support refund amounts and whether
  the resource refund has already been applied, preventing survivor fold-back
  refunds from replaying after reload.
- Existing schema-28 and older saves default ledgers to empty and refund stamps
  to zero/false; no destructive backfill is required.

## Schema 28

Force composition metadata.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `28`.
- `HST_ActiveGroupState`, `HST_SupportRequestState`, and
  `HST_EnemyOrderState` now persist composition request id, intent, selected
  tier, summary text, planned cost, planned manpower, planned vehicle count,
  and planned armed-vehicle count. Support requests and enemy orders also keep
  a composition failure reason.
- The persisted fields are diagnostics and replay hints only. Runtime entity,
  group, vehicle, and waypoint handles remain non-persisted.
- Existing schema-27 and older saves default these fields to empty strings and
  zero counts; no backfill is required.

## Schema 27

Player roster display names.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `27`.
- Runtime settings schema `13` adds `features.infiniteStaminaEnabled`,
  defaulting to `true` for generated and migrated settings. This is not a
  campaign-save migration.
- `HST_PlayerState` now persists `m_sDisplayName`, refreshed from the connected
  player manager when a player registers or is seen during menu/permission
  checks.
- Member and commander UI uses the display name for labels and only shows a
  shortened backend identity as secondary evidence.
- Permission checks, admin grants, loadouts, undercover state, and ownership
  records continue to use backend identity/SteamID64 values, not display names.
- Existing schema-26 and older saves default display names to empty and refresh
  them when the player reconnects.

## Schema 26

HQ spawn-point persistence and rebuild verification.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `26`.
- Campaign state now persists the HQ spawn-point position and prefab alongside
  Petros/cache/arsenal/tent HQ runtime metadata.
- Existing schema-25 and older deployed HQ saves backfill the spawn-point
  position near the HQ and clear the HQ runtime spawned flag so runtime objects
  are rebuilt with the new spawn point.
- Raw spawn-point entity handles remain runtime-only and are recreated by
  `HST_HQService`.

## Schema 25

Phase 24 balance, pacing, and campaign outcomes.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `25`.
- Campaign state now persists campaign-end reason, summary, elapsed second, control percent, war level, FIA/enemy zone counts, and whether an end report was generated.
- Existing schema-24 and older saves that were already WON/LOST backfill campaign-end fields from elapsed time, war level, and zone ownership counts.
- Runtime settings schema `9` adds balance knobs for starting training, war-level thresholds, victory/loss conditions, enemy income scaling, and aggression decay tuning.
- Balance and campaign-end reports are generated from existing zone/resource/mission state; raw world/runtime handles remain non-persistent.

## No Schema Bump: Phase 23 UI And Marker Polish

Phase 23 adds marker audits, command coverage reports, failed-action text, and
menu summary polish on top of existing persisted campaign state. These reports
are rebuilt from campaign fields such as markers, missions, support requests,
enemy orders, HQ/Petros state, civilian/undercover state, and runtime counters,
so no campaign save schema bump was required.

## Schema 24

Phase 22 HQ threat and Defend Petros.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `24`.
- Campaign state now persists HQ threat/knowledge diagnostics and active Defend Petros linkage.
- Defend Petros records persist linked mission/order/support/group ids, status, timing, attacker counts, failure reason, and outcome-applied flag.
- Existing schema-23 saves backfill HQ threat from HQ knowledge and mark existing Defend Petros mission ids as active.
- Raw Petros entities, attacker entities, AI groups, and runtime support entities remain runtime-only and are not persisted.

## Schema 23

Phase 21 undercover enforcement and police/roadblocks.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `23`.
- Undercover player records now persist applied/enforcement state, last compromise reason, detection source, enforcement zone, enforcement timestamps, detection score, and police/roadblock scan counters.

- Existing schema-22 records are backfilled from last eligibility/status/reason fields.
- Raw player entities, inventory handles, vehicle handles, and runtime civilian/police entities remain runtime-only and are not persisted.

## Schema 22

Phase 20 civilians, town support, and undercover reports.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `22`.
- Civilian town records now persist FIA support, occupier support, last incident reason, and last support-change time.
- Undercover player records now persist request state and the last detailed eligibility report: clothing, weapon/equipment, vehicle, off-road, enemy proximity, and wanted-heat reasons.
- Existing schema-21 civilian and undercover records are backfilled from reputation, support, police/roadblock presence, wanted heat, and last reason.
- Raw player entities, inventory handles, vehicle handles, and runtime civilian entities remain runtime-only and are not persisted.

## Schema 21

Phase 19 support request lifecycle hardening.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `21`.
- Support request records now persist runtime status, resolution kind, physicalization mode, activated time, physicalized time, resolved time, physicalized flag, and outcome-applied flag.
- Existing schema-20 support requests are backfilled from status, group linkage, strike runtime ID, and ETA.
- Raw `IEntity`, `AIGroup`, support component handles, spawned entities, and callback references remain runtime-only and are not persisted.

## Schema 20

Phase 18 enemy commander physical responses.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `20`.
- Enemy order records now persist support/group linkage, runtime status, source/target positions, physicalization time, resolution time, resolution kind, failure reason, and outcome flags.
- Existing schema-19 enemy orders are backfilled from status and support-request linkage.
- Raw `IEntity`, `AIGroup`, support component handles, and spawned entity references remain runtime-only and are not persisted.

## Schema 19

Phase 15 garage and vehicle persistence hardening.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `19`.
- Garage vehicle records and runtime vehicle records now persist source-vehicle
  capability fields: ammo source, repair source, fuel source, and source vehicle kind.
- Existing garage/runtime vehicle records are backfilled from prefab-based capability rules.
- Schema 19+ restores preserve persisted source capability fields; prefab backfill is only
  for pre-schema-19 records or newly captured world vehicles.
- Garage redeploy runtime vehicles are eligible for persistent field-vehicle restore.
- No raw `IEntity`, `AIGroup`, inventory handles, or runtime pointers are persisted.

## Schema 18

Phase 11 mission-specific convoy outcomes.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `18`.
- Active missions now persist convoy outcome-applied flags and a convoy outcome
  summary so mission-specific rewards and penalties do not replay after reload.
- Mission assets now persist an outcome-applied flag and outcome kind so captured
  convoy vehicles, payloads, and captives cannot duplicate asset-level outcomes.
- Existing saves default the new booleans to false and strings to empty during
  normal save-data migration/copy.
- No raw physical entities or runtime handles are persisted.

## Schema 17

Phase 7 convoy waypoint-chain movement.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `17`.
- Active convoy groups now persist `m_iAssignedWaypointCount` as diagnostic
  route-assignment state.
- Schema-16 convoy groups that already recorded `convoy_waypoints` are
  backfilled from their matching generated route waypoint count during
  save-data migration.
- No raw waypoint entities or AI waypoint references are persisted.

## Schema 16

Phase 3 convoy route state.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` is `16`.
- Generated routes now persist ordered `HST_RouteWaypointState` records.
- Schema-15 routes are backfilled from their legacy start, midpoint, and end
  positions during save-data migration/copy.
- Existing route start/mid/end fields remain for compatibility and are kept in
  sync with waypoint records.
- Route vehicle-safety validation is diagnostic state and can be recomputed from
  generated route waypoints.

## Schema 15

Baseline for the Phase 0/1 stabilization work.

- `HST_CampaignState.SCHEMA_VERSION` remains `15`.
- Persistence smoke-test baselines are stored in the existing persisted `HST_CampaignTaskState` array using `hst_smoke_persistence_expected`.
- Phase 1 zone composition spawn slots are generated at runtime and do not add persisted fields.
- Phase 2 capture diagnostics and notification de-dupe state are runtime-only; capture tuning moved through runtime settings schema `8` without changing campaign save fields.

# h-istasi Architecture

## Runtime Ownership

`HST_CampaignCoordinatorComponent` is the server-side entry point. It owns a
single `HST_CampaignState` and delegates to small services:

- `HST_EconomyService`: HR, faction money, support, aggression, and war level.
- `HST_MissionService`: mission eligibility, activation, deadlines, and
  completion rewards.
- `HST_PersistenceService`: native Reforger checkpoint requests and autosave
  debouncing.
- `HST_AuthorizationService`: persistent members, guests, admins, and the
  first commander-vacancy policy.
- `HST_StrategicService`: ownership changes, town support, Petros penalties,
  activation flags, and victory evaluation.
- `HST_ArsenalService`: item counts, unlock thresholds, and abstract garage
  records.
- `HST_EnemyDirectorService`: validated spending against separate attack and
  support pools.

The coordinator currently exposes server-only mutation methods that check
campaign phase, known IDs, and mission eligibility before changing state.
Client RPCs are intentionally withheld until player-owned request components
can authenticate the caller identity and enforce member, commander, and admin
permissions without trusting client-provided IDs.

## Authoring Contracts

The addon keeps authoring data separate from runtime state:

- `HST_CampaignPreset`: fixed scenario roles and capability switches.
- `HST_FactionTemplate`: faction identity and capability declarations.
- `HST_MapDefinition`: stable IDs for zones and hideout candidates.
- `HST_BalanceConfig`: Community Edition-derived initial values.
- `HST_MissionRegistryConfig`: mission definitions and deferred capabilities.

The checked-in `.conf` resources are the intended data source. The current
coordinator uses matching defaults while the resource loading and serializer
prefabs are connected in Workbench.

## Persistence

The persistence service uses `SaveGameManager.RequestSavePoint` so local hosts
and dedicated servers follow Reforger's native session-save path. The state
model is versioned from day one. A later increment must add a native scripted
serializer for `HST_CampaignState` and migration tests before save
compatibility is promised.

## World Layout

`Worlds/HST_Everon/HST_Everon.ent` is an original subscene over vanilla
Everon. Named layer files reserve ownership boundaries for physical authoring.
Strategic IDs live in `Configs/HST/Maps/HST_Everon.conf` so persistence does
not depend on fragile entity names.

The checked-in world shells include a base-backed AI world with explicit Eden
soldier and vehicle navmesh configs, a perception manager, faction, loadout,
radio, and chat managers so Workbench can initialize and play-test the plain
game mode without relying on Conflict's strategic brain.

Direct `.ent` Play mode currently uses a temporary RHS-backed spawn harness:
automatic player respawn is enabled, the spawn menu forces `PLAYERS`, and
`PLAYERS` resolves to `RHS_USAF` with a small RHS USMC player loadout set. This
is bootstrap-only; the HQ increment will replace it with FIA hideout/HQ spawn
routing after a safe hideout is selected. Workbench offline play may still log
blank identity ID errors from stock reconnect/editable-entity systems. Treat
those as non-blocking Workbench noise if a character is spawned and possessed.

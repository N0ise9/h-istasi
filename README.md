# h-istasi

h-istasi is an original Arma Reforger resistance-campaign implementation. The
first preset targets Everon with a three-way war:

- FIA: player resistance
- US: occupying force
- USSR: invading force

## Current Status

The repository contains a broad-alpha campaign foundation:

- Reforger base-game project dependency only
- APL-ND licensing and third-party attribution
- Original Everon and compact development scenario shells
- Data contracts for presets, factions, maps, zones, balance, and missions
- A versioned campaign-state model with arsenal, vehicle cargo, garage,
  saved-loadout, issued-item, mission-runtime, active-group, support, canonical
  exact-QRF operation, build-mode, campaign-end, and persistence metadata
- Server-authoritative campaign, economy, mission, persistence, arsenal, loot,
  loadout-editor, garage/build, and native-checkpoint services
- A 39-entry configured mission-registry baseline
- Custom FIA HQ player spawn path for direct Workbench Play mode
- FIA spawnpoint/loadout authoring metadata for authored hideout candidates
- Setup-phase HQ selection, HQ movement, and Petros state hooks for the first
  playable resistance-campaign slice
- Abstract campaign systems for player lifecycle, town income/support, zone
  capture, garrisons, recruitment/training, and mission rewards/penalties
- Native respawn-request bootstrap with pending spawn tracking to avoid
  Workbench duplicate-spawn loops
- Everon alpha anchors, generated-route response movement, routed infantry
  move/sweep waypoints, mixed response vehicle spawning, and route-aware zone
  activation scaffolding for the physical AI war
- Dedicated Petros character prefab at
  `Prefabs/Characters/HST/Character_HST_Petros.et` for HQ contextual actions,
  with GUID metadata and a base-FIA spawn fallback only if the custom resource
  fails to spawn
- HST-owned HQ arsenal action surface at
  `Prefabs/Objects/HST/HST_HQArsenal.et`; stock FIA arsenal/MSAR behavior is
  not used for item authority, issuing, or loadout accounting, and inherited
  stock arsenal actions are filtered away from the h-istasi action surface
- Custom h-istasi loadout editor with a client fullscreen widget, server-built
  payloads, live equipment/storage nodes, compatible candidate replacement,
  five fixed personal loadout slots under `$profile:h-istasi/loadouts/v2`,
  finite/INF accounting, atomic apply/rollback, and an issued-item ledger owned
  by campaign state
- Procedural h-istasi `I` key HQ menu mounted on both development
  worlds with Setup, Overview, HQ/Petros, Missions, Map/War, Forces,
  Arsenal/Loot, Garage/Build, Members, and Admin tabs
- First-load server settings generation at `$profile:h-istasi/HST_Settings.json`
  with config-backed defaults for campaign, factions, economy, membership,
  world activation, arsenal/loot, persistence, logging, and feature toggles,
  including configurable infinite stamina, live resistance support group map
  tracking, and population-based campaign outcomes
- Server-side area and vehicle loot actions that deposit eligible nearby gear
  into the campaign arsenal or vehicle cargo, remove transferred source items
  when configured, and reject raw visual/support assets
- Virtual garage and build-mode scaffolding for nearby vehicle capture,
  safe-root validation, cargo preservation, dry-ground redeploy placement,
  field-vehicle snapshot/restore, and HQ runtime-asset rebuilds
- Broad-alpha campaign scaffolding for generated Everon sites/routes, mission
  objectives, campaign tasks, physical mission-runtime primitives, support
  requests, enemy commander orders, civilian town state, and player undercover
  state
- HQ knowledge/threat state and Defend Petros linkage across mission, enemy
  order, support request, attacker-group, marker, and campaign-end state
- Enemy commander orders and support requests that can physicalize near players
  or resolve abstractly off-screen while preserving runtime status and outcome
  diagnostics
- Physical enemy response fold-back for support/QRF groups that leave the event
  bubble, preserving survivor state while removing live runtime handles
- Mixed personnel/vehicle active groups now use living personnel—not an intact
  empty vehicle—as combat-effectiveness authority. Once previously observed
  personnel reach zero outside population grace, the group becomes terminal,
  contributes no capture pressure, retires its linked QRF marker, and preserves
  an intact attached vehicle as neutral salvage. Unadopted vehicles are session-
  only; an existing durable field record and cargo remain durable. Terminal zero-survivor
  truth is retained across save normalization; the bounded lifecycle proof is
  implemented, while real combat/salvage/restart observation remains open.
- Physical support route truth that keeps spawned support state on the live
  member centroid, treats ETA as the earliest arrival observation rather than
  completion, requires two live samples from distinct elapsed seconds within
  75m for arrival or
  recall exit, and rebuilds direct current-to-target/exit waypoint chains with
  at most three consecutive reissues without an 8m new-best distance
  improvement. Pre-repair restored arrival/exit rows receive one current live-
  distance revalidation. Fresh
  packaged movement, arrival, and recall proof remains open.
- Town influence event ledger with support, reputation, heat, population, and
  security-pressure deltas feeding political ownership flips and debug reports
- Runtime and garage vehicle heat/report state for undercover vehicle cover,
  with passenger compromise counts, report expiry, capture/redeploy handoff,
  save-data preservation, and one-button debug proof
- Request-driven force composition for support, mission, garrison, and debug probes, with
  serializable intent, tier, cost, manpower, vehicle-plan, skipped-prefab, and
  failure metadata retained on support, enemy-order, and active-group records
- A schema-49 force/operation authority boundary with durable per-projection results,
  explicit force/projection identity on active groups, exact required-slot
  admission, bounded priority/FIFO scheduling and retention, retry/deadline/
  cancellation handling, dependency-ordered cleanup, Game Master registration
  evidence, once-per-restore reconciliation, and a canonical operation record for
  confirmed exact paid infantry QRFs
- Bounded accepted-settlement archives that replace eligible full quote,
  manifest, and linked ledger rows only after terminal aggregate proof and all
  physical/queue backlinks are gone. Compact rows preserve issue, confirmation,
  and committed-ledger replay for at least 86,400 campaign seconds; new planning
  fails closed when the shared history bound cannot safely make room.
- An engine-facing force-spawn adapter driven by the production coordinator once
  per active-campaign second. Its first exact slice creates one infantry group
  root plus every frozen member slot, records a durable nonterminal
  `READY_FOR_HANDOFF` boundary, finalizes the projection in physical war before
  recording queue success, and prevents older group-population paths from
  duplicating queue-owned projections
- The first exact player-paid support slice: selecting a QRF map target issues
  an immutable two-step server quote, confirmation charges a flat $250 plus one
  HR for every authored catalog member through linked ledger transactions, and
  the accepted one-group manifest is submitted unchanged to SpawnQueue. Failure
  and pre-success cancellation refund both transactions once; recall settles
  eligible HR through the same ledger.
- Support recall now returns a typed acceptance, mutation, terminal,
  disposition, request, and operation result. It is the first production
  visible command whose durable receipt status comes from that result instead
  of presentation wording. Exact full-refund settlement prevalidates both
  linked money and HR transaction identity, state, and deterministic settlement
  replay before refunding either transaction.
- Schema 49 gives each newly confirmed exact paid infantry QRF one versioned
  `OperationRecord`: immutable origin and assignment, mutable tactical target,
  typed duty/engagement/materialization/position/settlement state, stable
  execution links, revision, and terminal settlement identity. Queue admission,
  handoff, arrival, restore reprojection, recall, and terminal ledger paths now
  advance that record idempotently. The engagement transition API exists, but no
  live combat-contact adapter drives it yet; strategic route cursor/hysteresis,
  generalized virtualization, and other operation families remain open. Eight
  focused `operation_record.*` assertions are integrated into the existing
  force-authority campaign-debug case and compile, but they have not yet run in
  a packaged runtime.
- The first exact force-runtime lifecycle slice: handed-off member slots retain
  durable ever-alive/casualty evidence, confirmed dead members detach from the
  native and Game Master group without deleting their corpses, the last death
  retires the exact root/marker, and restart reprojects only durable survivors.
- Request-driven spawn placement for physical support and debug probes, with
  road/dry-ground/vehicle-safe validation, player/active-AI clearance checks,
  and visible placement failure reasons
- Enemy support-spend ledgers for QRF/support damage pressure, same-zone
  cooldowns, max defense spend caps, survivor refunds, reportable denial
  reasons, and separated proactive attack versus reactive support spending
- Civilian town support plus undercover eligibility, request/application,
  detection, police/roadblock scan, compromise, and clear-state enforcement
- Commander-facing no-admin actions for initial HQ selection, random mission
  start, objective/runtime inspection, FIA supply requests, support
  cancellation, civilian aid, support reports, garage/build reports,
  vehicle-cargo reports, loadout-editor status/application, generated content
  reports, persistence status, HQ threat reports, marker audits,
  balance/pacing reports, campaign-end reports, and undercover status/checks
- Phase 0/1 foundation and mission diagnostics are complete: the alpha command
  menu exposes foundation status, explicit checkpoint reporting, active mission
  inspection, selected mission inspection, and null-safe runtime mission fields
- Phase 2 convoy runtime diagnostics are complete: the Missions tab exposes a
  convoy runtime report with vehicle assets, active convoy groups, crew counts,
  travel distance, fallback mode, and explicit movement/spawn failure reasons
- Broad-alpha UI/report polish exposes marker status/detail/audit reports,
  command coverage smoke paths, clear failed-action text, HQ threat/Defend
  Petros reports, enemy order and physical-response reports, support
  ETA/status reports, balance/pacing diagnostics, and campaign-end summaries
- The latest packaged schema-48 check exposed a real Game Master and stock-HUD
  startup regression: config-backed modded editor, budget, and placed-marker
  classes had lost their original container metadata, so native config objects
  failed to load and editor/HUD initialization cascaded through a null manager.
  Current source restores the matching `BaseContainerProps` and custom-title
  attributes. Compilation now accepts those declarations, but the repair remains
  runtime-unverified until the next published server/client build.
- Admin-only campaign debug controls expose one-button smoke, physical, and
  full runtime verification profiles with status, cancel, cleanup, structured
  result artifacts, and bootstrap identity/admin evidence
- Persistent campaign win/loss state with schema-42 end reason, summary,
  elapsed time, strategic control, war level, FIA/enemy zone counts,
  population/support, airfield, outcome-mode, support deployment proof, and
  report generation metadata
- Versioned campaign save-data container that is migrated, tracked through
  `PersistenceSystem`, and flushed before native `SaveGameManager`
  checkpoint requests when saving is possible, with a profile JSON fallback at
  `$profile:h-istasi/HST_CampaignSaveData.json`

This is a broad-alpha campaign foundation, not a public alpha. Petros and the
HQ arsenal have live contextual-action prefabs for the alpha menu path, while
the arsenal, garage, and loadout editor remain custom h-istasi economy systems
instead of stock/MSAR arsenal behavior. The campaign loop is now connected far
enough to track HQ exposure, queue Defend Petros pressure, resolve support and
enemy orders physically or abstractly, enforce undercover state, publish marker
coverage, and persist won/lost campaign outcomes. The systems are still rough:
cache/tent polish, save/restart soak testing, final surveyed Everon
coordinates, richer AI waypoints, full loadout-editor HST_Dev smoke, garage
progression polish, balance tuning, and mission-specific interactable props
still need to be connected incrementally. The current exact adapter
supports exactly one infantry group root and its exact member slots; vehicle,
asset, and multi-root manifests fail closed as unsupported. Player-paid QRF is
the first support type migrated to this path and, in schema 49, the first force
with a canonical operation aggregate. Only newly confirmed exact paid player
infantry QRFs and uniquely coherent active schema-48 rows opt into that
contract; supply, search, roadblock, fire, air-support, legacy/enemy QRF,
garrison, mission, and enemy-order operations remain on legacy state. Current
garrison
purchase manifests contain purchase provenance rather than an executable group
root, so they remain intentionally nondeployable. Successful paid-QRF restore
now clears process-local IDs, retains confirmed casualty tombstones, and queues
one new root plus only durable surviving member slots. Initial deployment
failure still refunds money and HR; a technical reprojection failure retains the
already-delivered money cost and refunds surviving HR only. General lifecycle
authority for other force consumers remains open. Normal spawn
acquisition runs once per active-campaign second. During setup or after a won/
lost outcome, the coordinator cancels every nonterminal batch and drains its
cleanup with a monotonic runtime-only clock without advancing campaign elapsed
time. A batch whose exact slots are all verified remains durably
`READY_FOR_HANDOFF` until physical-war finalization succeeds; only then does the
queue record `SUCCEEDED`. Restoring the ready state clears process-local
evidence and requeues the exact realization instead of treating an interrupted
handoff as success. The physical HST_Dev proof is implemented, but it is not
runtime evidence until a fresh isolated run executes it.

## Current Delivery Priorities

The implementation blueprint's Campaign Runtime Integrity sequence controls
current work. Feature breadth already exists; the immediate goal is to make its
authority, runtime projection, persistence, and client evidence trustworthy:

1. Publish and retest the config-container metadata repair in a packaged
   dedicated-server/client connect. Require normal stock HUD initialization,
   working Game Master access, and zero unknown editor/budget/placed-marker
   config types. In the same boundary, prove late admin assignment produces no
   recursive player-role invoker exception.
2. Prove repaired civilian group projection in a fresh packaged run: zero
   unregistered group-member RPCs and actual pedestrian/traffic movement, not
   helper-entity counts alone.
3. Execute the isolated `HST_Dev` completion/cancellation/restart boundary and
   replace the historical Full Campaign Debug artifact with corrected evidence.
4. Runtime-prove exact paid-QRF creation, schema-49 operation registration and
   duty/materialization/recall/settlement transitions, casualty cleanup, survivor
   reprojection, settlement archival/replay, typed terminal-recall completion,
   rejected settlement conflicts, durable receipt replay, and once-only
   accounting across save/restart.
5. Runtime-prove the convoy pre-seat vehicle registration and authority-local
   pilot entry repair with 3/3 seated living drivers, then prove the repaired
   support route-truth boundary through actual movement, two-sample arrival,
   recall exit, and bounded transactional waypoint reissue in scoped disposable
   profiles. In the same disposable boundary, reproduce the crewless mixed-QRF
   case and prove one terminal transition, zero capture/marker pressure, one
   neutral salvage detachment, no duplicate vehicle, and no survivor
   resurrection after restart.
6. Prove static marker widget readiness plus authoritative host/client/late-join
   projection before treating marker publication as player-visible truth.
7. Resume deeper mission, civilian, undercover, commander, logistics, and
   balance expansion only after those integrity gates produce reliable evidence.

The schema-49 exact-QRF `OperationRecord` kernel is now implemented in source for
one already-exact force consumer. It does not complete the broader operations
milestone: live combat contact does not yet drive engagement transitions, and
strategic route progress/cursor/hysteresis, generalized virtualization,
vehicles/assets, other support consumers, garrisons, missions, enemy orders, and
client/JIP projection remain future slices.

The stamped schema-49 source tree passes foundation validation and creates the
Workbench Game module at 5,743 files, 11,497 classes, and CRC `4efe34fc`. A
fresh normal WorldEditor project open remained responsive at all ten two-second
samples and produced no unknown-config-class or crash signature before the
bounded gate stopped it at 20 seconds. This is source, compilation, and startup
evidence, not packaged runtime or restart evidence. The editor role-change guard
still needs a fresh packaged
dedicated-server connect before it counts as runtime proof, and the newly
restored config metadata still needs a published client/server retest before
Game Master or stock HUD recovery is claimed. The same inspected
server smoke tied 20 unregistered group-member RPCs one-for-one to 14 ambient
pedestrians and 6 traffic drivers. The civilian group root now inherits the
stock behavior/pathfinding/utility/replication base and initial members use the
native AI-composition attach path; traffic drivers also register their vehicle
before preferring authority-local pilot entry. Foundation validation, Workbench
Game compilation/creation, and a 20-second normal project-open survival gate
all pass.
Fresh packaged zero-RPC and distance-over-time movement proof remains required.
A separate normal-play artifact marked three physical support rows arrived even
though its logged targets and deterministic recall-exit vectors imply nominal
current positions approximately 434m, 455m, and 505m away. Current source removes that ETA-only completion
shortcut. A Phase 22 group populated 9/9 without observed advance, but that
artifact sampled campaign time rather than live physical positions, so it is not
standalone physical-stall proof. Fresh packaged support movement, arrival, and
recall evidence is still required.

For documentation authority, `docs/FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md` owns current feature
status and next tasks; `docs/HST_CAMPAIGN_DEBUG_VERIFICATION_AUDIT.md` owns the
latest runtime evidence; `docs/MIGRATIONS.md` owns save-schema history; and the
top CRI sections of `docs/PHASE_PLAN.md` own delivery order. The numbered phase
details remain acceptance/history material and do not override those current
sections.

## Alpha Command Menu

Press `I` in `HST_Dev` or `HST_Everon` to open the h-istasi alpha command
menu. The menu is a client widget driven by server-built snapshots and renders
a campaign HQ interface with a resource bar, navigation, campaign
cards, action list, and activity/result feed. The Setup tab displays the
effective server config and lets the commander choose the first HQ hideout
before the campaign enters the active phase. `$profile:h-istasi/HST_Settings.json`
remains the source of truth for defaults that apply to newly created
campaigns, but initial HQ placement is selected through the setup map flow and
the generated runtime settings no longer expose a default hideout id. The file
uses JSON-safe `_comment` fields to explain settings because raw JSON comments
are not supported. The same settings file also controls h-istasi's Game Master budget
policy through `features.gameMasterBudgetsEnabled`, which defaults to `false`
so GM placement budgets are disabled automatically on game start.
`features.infiniteStaminaEnabled` defaults to `true`; when enabled, local
player stamina is refilled through the native stamina component and the sprint
exhaustion vignette/blur effect is suppressed.
`features.trackResistanceSupportGroupsOnMap` defaults to `true`; when enabled,
spawned player-requested resistance support groups keep a live map marker until
the group is killed, folded, or despawned.

During initial HQ placement the setup map owns keyboard input; complete HQ
placement first, then `I` opens the command menu and server snapshots add the
Admin tab for configured SteamID64 admins.

- `MenuUp` / `MenuDown`: change selection
- `MenuSelect`: run the selected command
- `MenuBack` or `I`: close the menu

The menu routes through server-authoritative coordinator requests and covers
campaign overview, markers and marker audits, economy, balance/pacing,
campaign-end state, zones, missions, mission runtime, manual checkpoint,
persistence status, income tick, training, first HQ selection, HQ movement, HQ
threat, Defend Petros, FIA recruitment, mission start, random mission
selection, objective progress, support requests/cancellation and ETA/status,
enemy order/physical-response reports, civilian aid, undercover
eligibility/request/check/clear flows, zone capture/activation, arsenal
reporting, vehicle cargo, garage capture/redeploy, nearby loot collection,
loadout editor status/application, generated content reports, HQ asset rebuilds,
command coverage and failed-action smoke reports, roster admin helpers,
campaign reset, one-button campaign debug verification, and small debug
resource awards. Commander support and garrison call-ins use the normal in-game
map for target selection and are disabled when the commander has no map gadget.
Garrison and player-QRF targeting issue exact server quotes; the Forces tab then
shows the frozen count/cost and confirms or cancels only the actor-owned quote
ID through a confirmation dialog.
Multiplayer clients use a player-owned request/RPC component;
the server resolves the caller from ownership instead of trusting a client
provided player ID. Petros opens this same menu path through contextual
interactions, and the visible HQ arsenal is backed by the same server commands
from the Arsenal/Loot tab.

## Admin and Runtime Debug

To grant h-istasi admin rights on a local or dedicated server, add the player's
raw 17-digit SteamID64 to `membership.adminIdentityIds` in
`$profile:h-istasi/HST_Settings.json`. Backend UUIDs, BattleEye GUIDs,
`workbench_player_N` aliases, and per-session player IDs are not durable
h-istasi admin tokens.

The Admin tab exposes `Run Full Campaign Debug` as a one-button diagnostic
harness. It is not runtime certification by itself. In-process debug profiles
are restricted to `HST_Dev`, run against a cloned campaign state, suspend real
campaign checkpoints, and restore the untouched live state on completion or
cancel. A development-session restart is still required because world entities,
player state, and service caches are outside campaign save data. External,
restart, and soak profiles require a separately managed disposable profile and
launcher instead of starting through the in-process runner. Results are written under
`$profile:h-istasi/debug` as structured JSON, summary text, and state-diff text.
A valid admin grant should be visible in logs as a
`settings SteamID64` runtime grant, and command-menu input diagnostics log the
local `I` key/action path when troubleshooting menu access.

For dedicated server tests, repack/publish the Workbench addon before launching
the dedicated server. Server boot, admin diagnostics, command-menu readiness,
and structured debug artifacts must report the same runtime identity from
`HST_BuildInfo`: full commit SHA, UTC build time, label, campaign schema 49, and
runtime-settings schema. Missing or mismatched identity means the packaged
server/client runtime is stale or mixed, even if the repository is newer.

## Design Rules

- Prefix addon-owned scripts and resources with `HST_`.
- Keep the strategic campaign server-authoritative.
- Use native Reforger persistence and session saves.
- Keep off-screen forces abstract and activate physical AI only around
  players and active objectives.
- Track feature-complete campaign work in `docs/FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md` and keep
  planning docs focused on h-istasi behavior, status, gaps, and acceptance
  tests.
- Do not copy source assets from neighboring addons.
- Do not add hidden dependencies.

## Development Scenarios

- `Missions/HST_Everon.conf`: full-island campaign shell
- `Missions/HST_Dev.conf`: compact systems-development shell

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md`,
`docs/HST_CAMPAIGN_DEBUG_VERIFICATION_AUDIT.md`, `docs/PARITY.md`, and
`docs/PHASE_PLAN.md` for the implementation map, feature checklist, runtime
verification audit, and current phase roadmap.

# HST Campaign Debug Verification Audit

Date: 2026-07-03


Verdict: not fully implemented.

The current `Run Campaign Debug` implementation is a useful certification scaffold. It is no longer just a string/report smoke runner: it has typed results, deterministic debug run prefixes, artifacts, status/cancel/cleanup commands, stronger bootstrap/preflight/HQ/economy assertions, convoy readiness/progress probing, a POW captive free/follow probe, Phase 24 pacing/end assertions, and mission cleanup checks.

It does not yet satisfy the full pasted contract for a complete one-button in-game verification suite. Large areas remain legacy string-wrapped smoke checks or are not represented at all.

## Implemented Evidence

- Admin command wiring exists for start/status/cancel/cleanup in `Scripts/Game/HST/Services/HST_CommandUIService.c`.
- The coordinator exposes `RequestAdminRunCampaignDebug`, `RequestAdminCampaignDebugStatus`, `RequestAdminCancelCampaignDebug`, and `RequestAdminCleanupCampaignDebug`.
- The runner remains sequenced through bootstrap, baseline, HQ, economy/support, early mechanics, mission sweep, phase smoke, final report, and completion.
- Run profiles are accepted as `smoke`, `physical`, and `full`: `smoke` skips the long early/mission/phase sweeps, `physical` keeps early mechanics plus the mission/physical sweep and skips late phase smoke, and `full` preserves the complete sequence.
- Typed result classes exist in `Scripts/Game/HST/Data/HST_CampaignDebugResult.c`.
- Artifacts write to `$profile:h-istasi/debug` as JSON, summary text, and state-diff text.
- Runs now record a deterministic debug marker prefix, mission prefix, and entity tag in JSON, summary, state-diff, and status output.
- Run start removes stale `hst_debug_`-prefixed persisted state before capturing start counts. Forced debug-started missions are retagged before objective/runtime initialization so derived objective/runtime/asset/group/marker records inherit the run prefix.
- Debug-created player support, Phase 19 support smoke records, and Phase 17/18/22 enemy-order seeds are retagged with the current run prefix before marker refresh/report output; support request cases assert the prefix directly.
- Bootstrap records typed assertions for server authority, debug actor access, active campaign repair, HQ state, Petros state, teleport, and player presence.
- Preflight records typed assertions for key services, mission registry count/uniqueness/runtime/duration, compatible debug target zones, default faction/civilian prefab resource resolution, runtime-selected mission prop/vehicle prefab resolution, runtime waypoint prefab resolution, zone graph counts, and physical-war setting.
- HQ runtime records typed assertions for runtime flag, tracked Petros/cache/arsenal/tent/spawn-point entity count, Petros/cache/arsenal/tent/spawn-point runtime entity keys and positions, arsenal usability, HQ marker, active admin command-menu campaign-debug controls, command coverage, and player position.
- Economy records typed exact-delta assertions for resource awards and training.
- Stage 3 support requests now clear prior player support, call the real support command, assert the created support request record type, faction, target zone/position, ETA, money cost, status, marker publication/pending state, controlled ETA progression, and QRF/search ground-support physicalization into linked active groups before cleaning the debug probe.
- Civilian aid now records typed money/support/heat assertions, and support cancellation now seeds and cancels a real player support request by ID.
- Phase 20/21 smoke now records typed town support, wanted heat, eligibility, clear-heat, undercover apply, weapon/vehicle compromise, roadblock/police scan, and clear-heat assertions.
- Phase 18/19 smoke now records typed enemy-order/support assertions for debug-prefixed records, order/support type, faction/player-requested policy, target validity, resource cost fields, open-order resolution, and forced-ETA inbound support evidence. Phase 18 also seeds a background-war state, runs the normal commander tick threshold, and asserts occupier/invader order creation, POI targets, duplicate guards, source/target positions, context-appropriate order types, and enemy pool spending.
- Phase 14 smoke now records typed arsenal assertions for finite-only loot, threshold unlock behavior at count 2, blocked-prefab rejection, raw visual asset rejection, and final report consistency.
- Phase 15 smoke now records typed garage/source-vehicle assertions for stored vehicle records, debug-run ID prefixing, vehicle-root eligibility, redeploy metadata, cargo preservation, ammo-source metadata, and report source counts.
- Phase 16 smoke now records typed garrison/training assertions for selected recruit-zone readiness, resistance garrison records, infantry deltas, zero-cost money/HR behavior, capacity bounds, and zero-cost training level deltas.
- Phase 17 smoke now records typed capture/counterattack assertions for seeded capturable zones, ownership flip, progress reset, starter resistance garrison, debug-prefixed counterattack orders, order costs/positions/status, marker/report evidence, real enemy-order physicalization into a prefixed support request, linked active-group runtime spawn, and one routed distance-decrease sample toward the captured zone.
- Phase 22 smoke now records typed HQ/Defend Petros assertions for seeded HQ knowledge/threat, debug-prefixed Petros attack orders, debug-prefixed dynamic defense mission/objective/task records, active mission markers, linked support request evidence, admin-success resolution, Petros kill/runtime-clear behavior, and campaign-debug Petros/HQ recovery. Physical attacker movement/wave advance remains WARN/not covered.
- Phase 23 smoke now records typed UI/marker assertions for command coverage detail rows, admin menu campaign-debug/Phase-23 controls, marker model counts, HQ/mission/support/QRF marker coverage, marker backing-state consistency, native marker report availability, native marker purge reporting, player marker report inclusion, and the intentional failed-action sample as WARN evidence.
- Phase 24 smoke now records typed campaign pacing/end assertions for early/mid/late seeded resource profiles, control percent, FIA/enemy zone counts, max enemy pool pressure, forced victory phase/reason/control metadata, and forced loss threshold metadata.
- Convoy physical probing asserts vehicle asset counts, spawned vehicle entities, crew groups, alive crew, seated drivers, mobile vehicles, route assignment, waypoint assignment, readiness, progress sample presence, and hard-stuck count.
- POW/captive probing uses real `mission_captive_extract` and `mission_captive_follow` interactions and asserts freed/following carrier state.
- Mission cleanup checks active mission status, unresolved assets, mission-owned groups, and linked markers.
- The state-diff artifact snapshots start/end objectives, runtime vehicles, mission assets, active groups, support requests, enemy orders, markers, garage vehicles, arsenal items, civilian zones, and undercover records.
- Admin cleanup and run completion now record typed prefixed-state cleanup cases for missions, objectives, runtime entities, mission assets, active groups, runtime vehicles, garage vehicles, QRFs, support requests, enemy orders, map markers, and campaign tasks, then rebuild campaign markers when marker-backed state changed.
- Final completion now records a typed cleanup leak snapshot for active missions, player support, enemy orders, active groups, markers, current/early debug mission IDs, and remaining `hst_debug_`-prefixed persisted records.
- Non-legacy typed cases now emit a `post_case_cleanup.*` leak probe while the runner is active. The probe allows the mission intentionally under test, preserves pre-existing active mission IDs from the run-start snapshot, and asserts unexpected active missions, orphan mission assets, orphan active groups, orphan linked markers, and backing states missing markers.
- The summary artifact now includes feature, mission, physical AI, and cleanup matrices built from typed case results, plus failure inspection command hints for non-pass cases.

## Not Fully Implemented

- HQ checks now prove tracked runtime entity keys and positions for Petros/cache/arsenal/tent/spawn-point after rebuild and verify active admin command-menu campaign-debug controls, but they do not scan the wider world for duplicate HQ entities.
- Debug cleanup is deterministic for persisted state and marker records, but it still does not perform a generic world scan for arbitrary untracked physical entities by tag.
- Stage 3 support/civilian/undercover coverage is still partial: it now asserts request records, controlled ETA progression, QRF/search physicalization, support cancellation, town aid deltas, and undercover phase transitions, but it does not prove support group movement/arrival, civilian physical population/faction/vehicle behavior, or town flip behavior.
- Early mechanics are mostly still report/action wrappers. Generated content, zone activation spawn/cleanup, civilian aid bounds, support cancellation cleanup, garage/vehicle/loadout action tests, and UI coverage are not upgraded to hard typed assertions.
- The all-mission sweep does not run primitive-specific physical probes for `kill_hvt`, `hold_area`, `clear_area`, `destroy_target`, `recover_cargo`, `deliver_supplies`, or most `rescue_extract` cases. Admin completion is still the common mission end path.
- Convoy probing uses existing readiness/progress status, but it does not actively sample positions every few seconds over a movement window or prove phase history from staging to moving to contact to arrival/elimination.
- The POW/captive probe verifies free/follow state once; it does not prove distance decreases over time, boarding/transport behavior, extraction completion, alive captive count, or reward/support/HR deltas.
- Phase 14-24 smoke steps remain partly legacy string classifications outside the newly typed Phase 14 arsenal, Phase 15 garage/source-vehicle, Phase 16 garrison/training, Phase 17 capture/counterattack state and first physical route sample, Phase 18/19 enemy/support, Phase 20/21 civilian/undercover, Phase 22 HQ/Defend Petros, Phase 23 UI/markers, and Phase 24 pacing/end probes. Defend Petros attacker movement/waves still need stronger typed assertions. Phase 16 proves abstract garrison/training state only; it does not physicalize recruited units. Phase 17 now samples one physical counterattack support group advancing, but it does not prove multi-wave/contact/arrival/resolution behavior. Phase 22 proves HQ/order/mission/task/marker/recovery state only; it does not sample attacker movement. Phase 23 proves command/marker model state and native report/purge availability, but it does not visually inspect rendered map widgets. Phase 24 does not yet prove long-window escalation pressure or post-end service inactivity.
- Background war and commander target testing is folded into the Phase 18 typed smoke step rather than implemented as a separate stage. It verifies command selection/resource spending for one controlled tick, but it does not prove physical group movement/arrival or long-running occupier-vs-invader campaign dynamics.
- Quantitative war level escalation/aggression pressure tests over controlled windows are not implemented; Phase 18 now proves one seeded commander tick and Phase 24 checks seeded profiles/max enemy pools only.
- Counterattack physical spawn/advance is now sampled once through Phase 17's real enemy-order/support/active-group route path, but counterattack wave/contact/arrival/resolution behavior is not yet implemented as a typed test.
- Player render-bubble tests for far/near/leave/mission-assets/convoy-expired behavior are not implemented.
- Persistence roundtrip/temp-restore tests for active missions, field vehicles, garage/cargo, undercover, and civilian state are not implemented. Real restart/multiclient soak remains a warning gap.
- Final artifacts include the requested summary matrix sections, but those matrices still expose partial coverage because many underlying cases remain legacy string wrappers.
- Cleanup leak checks now run after non-legacy typed cases, but legacy string-wrapped smoke cases still need migration before every major case has equivalent cleanup evidence. Prefixed persisted state cleanup exists, but arbitrary untracked world-entity deletion by tag remains outside the current service boundary.
- Stall detection and timeout evidence dumps are not implemented for physical tests.

## Validation Run

- `git diff --check` passed, with only CRLF warnings reported by Git.
- Basic brace counts matched for the touched script files.
- `tools/validate-foundation.ps1` passed.

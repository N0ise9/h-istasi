## Release decision

**NO-GO - development alpha.** No release-candidate package is certified.

The retained candidate identity below binds its exact source HEAD, manifest, canonical four-file package index, addon identity, and validation tools. The generator verifies that the candidate source is between the audited gameplay revision and the live checkout HEAD.

## Proof ladder

A pass never inherits upward. `partial` means some scoped evidence exists but the rung is not passed for the enabled campaign.

| Rung | Status | Honest scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static/source/resource contracts | `passed` | Retained Foundation evidence is green inside the immutable candidate build for its exact source HEAD. |
| Enforce compile and configuration | `passed` | All five explicit Workbench targets are retained and green for the candidate source and canonical four-file package build. |
| Deterministic service contracts | `passed-noncertifying` | All five canonical packaged focused service suites passed against the exact retained package: JUnit 5/0/0/0, all 40 envelope files rehashed, 11 approved and zero unapproved hard diagnostics, and zero cleanup or spill residue. This lower-rung result is non-certifying and does not override the later full-profile rejection. |
| Native engine-world behavior | `failed` | The corrected force-authority canary passed its scoped gate, but Full Campaign Debug rejected the same exact package at 598 PASS, 47 WARN, 26 FAIL, 13 BLOCKED, and 1 SKIPPED with 5630/5695 required assertions proven and 24 unapproved hard diagnostics. The retained native engine-world rung is failed. |
| Packaged dedicated server | `not-run` | The retained candidate was rejected by Full Campaign Debug before the standard dedicated-server runtime gate; that gate remains not run. |
| Multiple clients, reconnect, and JIP | `not-run` | Host, two-client, reconnect, late-join, and packet-disruption convergence are not certified. |
| Fresh-process restart and fault injection | `partial` | Selected journal, shutdown, field-vehicle, exact-QRF, counterattack, and rebuild cuts pass; the arbitrary full campaign graph and fault matrix remain open. |
| Performance and long soak | `not-run` | The reported one-second hitch and long-campaign capacity limits have no current immutable-package soak evidence. |
| Canary release | `blocked` | Blocked because the retained exact package failed Full Campaign Debug and is rejected-after-runtime; a new immutable candidate must restart the proof ladder. |
| Stable certification | `blocked` | No current matrix row is certified; full-profile proof failed, and dedicated, multiplayer, restart, performance, soak, and release-canary gates remain incomplete. |

## Retained evidence

- Foundation: **passed** at 874 references for `ee0e8add2a298e83fd304b7660c4fc480dc6383f`.
- Workbench: **passed** at 5848 files / 11901 classes / CRC `f64e0868` for `ee0e8add2a298e83fd304b7660c4fc480dc6383f`.
- Retained rejected paired release-surface/runtime-retention evidence: **not run** for candidate `partisan-rc-ee0e8add2a29-20260719T063815Z`; both halves must be published and consumed together against the unchanged package before either result may attach.
- Retained rejected packaged focused autotests: **5/5** cases and JUnit **5/0/0/0** tests/failures/errors/skips against exact candidate `partisan-rc-ee0e8add2a29-20260719T063815Z`. Hard diagnostics are explicitly not free: 11 total = 10 approved stock + 1 approved intentional + 0 unapproved, with 40 envelope files rehashed and zero cleanup/spill residue. Summary: `docs/evidence/focused-autotest/partisan-rc-ee0e8add2a29-20260719T063815Z.json` / SHA-256 `0a8fcfc5ca739ff261be644cdfcb02311e4ef967c374f093e2963e4b1374800b`; clean harness `273ed14ba8526259c8b0d248177fa53b59ade683`. This exact-package deterministic-service result is non-certifying and does not color the native-engine-world rung.
- Retained rejected corrected force-authority canary: **accepted, passed-noncertifying** on exact candidate `partisan-rc-ee0e8add2a29-20260719T063815Z`. The focused proof passed 35/35 assertions and 87/87 counted conditions; the 33-check classifier accepted 2 hard diagnostics = 2 approved stock + 0 approved intentional + 0 unapproved. All 10 envelope files were rehashed with an exact 18-row zero-delta state diff, final orphan cleanup, and zero cleanup/spill residue.

This scoped canary does not certify Full Campaign Debug.
- Retained rejected Full Campaign Debug: **rejected, red full profile** on exact candidate `partisan-rc-ee0e8add2a29-20260719T063815Z`. The wrapper capture completed mechanically with stable artifacts, 10 rehashed envelope files, and zero cleanup/spill residue, while runtime acceptance remained false. Certification stayed red at 598 PASS, 47 WARN, 26 FAIL, 13 BLOCKED, and 1 SKIPPED with 5630/5695 required assertions proven, 50 failed, and 15 blocked. The fail-closed classifier found 26 hard diagnostics = 2 approved stock + 0 approved intentional + 24 unapproved.

Mechanical capture success is not certification or diagnostic acceptance.
- Focused force-authority profile: **35/35** cases and **87/87** counted conditions for `32727238d74b29905c68e5a80bb5897dfdc783c0`, with `CertificationPassed:false`. This is historical state-only, non-package, non-certifying evidence.

This immutable scoped acceptance does not transfer to the retained rejected candidate.
- Historical Full Campaign Debug: **rejected, red full profile** on prior exact candidate `partisan-rc-0e632ec4f63e-20260719T004133Z`. The wrapper capture completed mechanically with stable artifacts, 10 rehashed envelope files, and zero cleanup/spill residue, while runtime acceptance remained false. Certification stayed red at 584 PASS, 49 WARN, 46 FAIL, 7 BLOCKED, and 1 SKIPPED with 5561/5687 required assertions proven, 112 failed, and 14 blocked.

This immutable rejection does not transfer to the retained rejected candidate.
- Historical Full Campaign Debug: **stopped and not run** for prior exact candidate `partisan-rc-e11e7ea88a44-20260719T040154Z`; its `rejected-after-corrected-canary` contract ended the chain at the rejected corrected canary.

## Specification coverage

- CE 3.11.1 product contract rows: **24** (development-only 1; legacy 3; missing 2; partial 18).
- Configured/runtime mission rows: **39/39**, all mapped to a product contract row.
- Routed command/action IDs: **177**, exact source/manifest set match and all mapped.
- Concrete contextual action classes: **17**, exact source/manifest set match and all mapped.
- Product specification: `docs/ANTISTASI_CE311_PARITY_MATRIX.md`.

Coverage means the surface is named and classified. It does not mean the behavior is exact or certified.

## Active blockers

| ID | Category | Blocker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STATUS-001` | `AUTH` | The retained ee0 package keeps green Foundation, all-target Workbench, five-case packaged focused evidence, and an accepted corrected force-authority canary, but its Full Campaign Debug result is red and its runtime disposition is rejected-after-runtime. No lower-rung or historical result overrides that rejection. |
| `STATUS-002` | `TEST` | Full Campaign Debug rejected the exact ee0 package at 26 failed cases, 13 blocked cases, 50 failed required assertions, 15 blocked required assertions, and 24 unapproved diagnostics. Triage those clusters, seal source fixes in a new immutable candidate, and restart focused, corrected-canary, and full gates without attaching new evidence to ee0. |
| `STATUS-003` | `UI` | Known command-menu and modal-map defects remain open until source correction plus rendered packaged-client proof. |
| `STATUS-004` | `MOVE` | Natural sustained infantry and convoy travel, identical-waypoint suppression, and measured no-stutter behavior are not proven. |
| `STATUS-005` | `PROJ` | Campaign read-model convergence is not proven with host, two clients, reconnect, JIP, restart, and marker-cap boundaries. |
| `STATUS-006` | `PERF` | The one-second hitch and bounded-history admission cliffs remain unclosed. |
| `STATUS-007` | `MISSION` | Configured mission breadth still exceeds mission-specific CE 3.11.1 behavioral parity and proof. |
| `STATUS-008` | `SEC` | Development proof and destructive diagnostic surfaces have not yet been separated from the release package. |

## Next release-closure step

The retained candidate's Full Campaign Debug result is rejected at 26 failed cases, 13 blocked cases, 50 failed required assertions, 15 blocked required assertions, and 24 unapproved diagnostics, and its rejected-after-runtime disposition blocks further runtime consumption. Triage that exact-package result, seal source fixes in a new immutable candidate, and restart focused -> corrected canary -> full from the new package.

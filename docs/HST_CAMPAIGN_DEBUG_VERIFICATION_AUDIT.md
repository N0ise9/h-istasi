# Partisan Campaign Debug Verification Audit

## Current Workbench Crash Triage Boundary

The reported 2026-07-13 Workbench failure is captured in
`logs_2026-07-13_19-41-00`. Its dump records native heap corruption
`0xc0000374` in `ntdll.dll`; the process stopped before `Module: Game`, and the
preceding log contains no HST or `SCRIPT (E)` diagnostic. This is a real failed
Workbench gate, but it does not by itself identify a Partisan-owned script fault.

The same current tree subsequently survived six independent cold interactive
opens: `logs_2026-07-13_22-19-40`, `logs_2026-07-13_22-20-58`,
`logs_2026-07-13_22-21-11`, `logs_2026-07-13_22-21-24`,
`logs_2026-07-13_22-22-07`, and `logs_2026-07-13_22-22-56`. The set includes a
visible normal project open and a visible Script Editor open. Each completed
Game load used CRC `fd9e2cf4`, no run produced a fatal/script-error row or crash
artifact, and cleanup left zero Workbench processes. Following the later crash
report, a seventh controlled project open in `logs_2026-07-13_22-50-48` again
loaded Game CRC `fd9e2cf4`, created the game, remained responsive for nearly two
minutes, and shut down cleanly with no fault event. A preceding automation
attempt supplied the project without its base-game and Workbench addon roots;
its `Game addon ... not found` / `Cannot initialize game project settings`
shutdown is a launch-harness error before scripts compile and is not a Partisan
crash. Current classification is therefore interactive-startup stable with one
earlier intermittent native crash that is not presently reproducible. No
speculative project-code patch is justified by this evidence. A recurrence
needs the fresh log directory and dump from that attempt plus the exact action
that preceded it; it must not be merged with the earlier event or reported as
fixed without a repeatable cause.

## Schema 70 Exact Enemy Garrison Rebuild Engine-Proof Boundary

The active development tree uses Campaign Schema 70 while runtime settings
remain on Schema 24. Newly admitted exact enemy garrison rebuilds use contract
`1`, spend exactly 10 support resources and zero attack resources, and freeze and
preflight the exact roster plus selected-zone ownership capability before the
debit. After debit, admission builds the reciprocal order/operation/manifest/
held-batch/active-group aggregate or applies the exact full rollback. Contract-
`0` historical rebuild orders remain isolated from the exact consumer;
migration does not infer a missing exact graph.

The frozen roster remains authoritative through virtual movement,
materialization, physical casualties, fold back to strategic hold, restore, and
re-materialization. A successful arrival transfers only living exact members to
a held target garrison, leaves the pre-existing aggregate count unchanged, and
records a zero-delta delivery receipt. Delivery keeps the operation `OPEN` and
`ON_STATION`; a later terminal event unlinks and retires the roster with zero
refund. Failure before arrival refunds support in proportion to living frozen
members; confirmed casualties are never restored or refunded as survivors.

Admission freezes both source and target ownership revisions as well as their
owners. A source or target ownership ABA transition is rejected even when its
owner string returns to the selected value, because the revision has advanced.
Initial admission rejects before pressure; a pressure-marked retry rechecks the
capability and rejects before order creation or debit.
Settlement recovery accepts both durable crash tails: a `PREPARED` operation
whose refund receipt already exists, and a `SETTLED` operation whose order/runtime
tail is stale. Reconciliation completes the tail exactly once without duplicating
resource mutations.

Malformed current authority quarantines at `-70`. Quarantine covers every
matching operation/order claimant plus all directly, deterministically, or
transitively claimed batches and groups. Nonterminal runtime claimants become
idempotent strategic holds; orphan exact claimants are held by the same policy.
No claimant is guessed away, settled, refunded, or converted into aggregate
strength. Generic force normalization and duplicate-identity finalization defer
to retained Schema-70 quarantined claimants; unrelated healthy duplicate rows
retain the existing fail-closed behavior.

The scoped engine-proof checkpoint is sealed at implementation
`2f71236bfc02329a3c8000b104f1b7b1043dc99c`, UTC
`2026-07-13T22:20:52Z`, label
`schema70-settings24-exact-enemy-garrison-rebuild-engine-proof`, with stamp commit
`ef95555`. Fresh post-integration Workbench log
`logs_2026-07-13_20-50-56` completes compile/create successfully at Game CRC
`fd9e2cf4` with a clean exit and zero Workbench processes. Final focused log
`logs_2026-07-13_20-51-20` records one
`HST_TEST_EnemyGarrisonRebuildAuthority` JUnit testcase with zero failures,
`AllExact=1`, all 13 headline flags at `1`, zero surviving processes, and
successful claimant-wide quarantine replay/idempotency evidence. Foundation
passes at 790 script-symbol references. The focused environment also records the
known recoverable `GetPlayerIdentityId` VM exception plus two
`SCR_FilterCategory` non-public-constructor diagnostics during harness setup.
The focused run succeeds but is not exception-free.

The post-seal Full Campaign Debug wiring now retains stable IDs for all created
enemy orders without rewriting debit-backed or exact-operation identities.
Phase 18 background-war setup and every Phase 24 ownership or absolute-pool
rewrite first run a fail-closed isolation gate. Exact QRF, counterattack,
patrol, and rebuild orders use their typed administrative settlement paths;
success requires a valid terminal ledger and zero batch, group, adapter,
physical-root, or runtime-member claimants. Contract-zero rows use the enemy
commander/PhysicalWar legacy owner and prove their original debit plus one
deterministically identified, correctly shaped and ordered refund mutation.
Escalation profiles and aggression decay stop after any isolation failure, and
terminal inactivity snapshots wait for one maintenance frame before sampling.
These paths compile and are statically guarded, but remain unexecuted in Full
Campaign Debug.

This seals source, Foundation, stamped Workbench compile/create, and focused
engine proof only. Schema-70 deterministic assertions are wired in Full Campaign
Debug `early_mechanics.force_authority`, and its live rebuild smoke belongs to
Phase 18 `enemy_commander`; neither has run. Phase 17 remains zone capture plus
the Schema-69 exact-counterattack path. Packaged/native/live-server runtime,
serialization and restart, migration runtime, multiplayer/network/JIP/reconnect,
and soak gates remain open.

## Preceding Schema 69 Exact Enemy Counterattack Engine-Proof Boundary

That checkpoint used Campaign Schema 69 while runtime settings remained on
Schema 24. Newly admitted enemy counterattacks use
contract `1` and one reciprocal order/operation/frozen-manifest/held-batch/
active-group aggregate. The intended proof boundary includes direct virtual
travel, physical/virtual casualty continuity, deterministic virtual combat,
canonical ownership transition and retry, return-to-origin duty, and a
survivor-proportional refund to exactly one originally charged attack or support
pool. Historical counterattacks restored from Schema 68 or earlier remain
contract `0`. Invalid or ambiguous current exact graphs quarantine at `-69`
without fabricated or deleted authority, refund, settlement, or outcome.

The persisted settlement enum appends `PREPARED` after the existing values.
That state is durable terminal intent: prepare the operation, stage the exact
order/refund tuple, apply or replay the refund, record the strategic resource
receipt, then finalize the operation and reciprocal runtime rows. Restore and
same-session execution resume any accepted prefix. Explicit backlinks plus
deterministically derived batch, projection, force, and execution identities
participate in ambiguity checks, including optional residue from an uncommitted
full-refund crash window.

The scoped engine-proof checkpoint is sealed at implementation
`5bdcda938840ab769b41ff3e1856d908572a8c45`, UTC
`2026-07-13T19:40:35Z`, label
`schema69-settings24-exact-enemy-counterattack-engine-proof`, with stamp commit
`73a64ef`. Foundation passes at 771 script-symbol references. Final all-five
Workbench log `logs_2026-07-13_15-41-50` exits `0`, compiles 5,821 Game files/
11,786 classes at CRC `3a8bd64f`, explicitly validates WORKBENCH, PC, XBOX, PS4,
and PS5, contains no script or HST errors, and leaves zero Workbench processes.

Focused engine log `logs_2026-07-13_15-42-52` exits `0`, records one passing
JUnit testcase, an empty failed list, and `AllExact=1`. Valid PREPARED recovery,
same-session ABORTED recovery, foreign derived-ID collision hold, and fail-closed
SETTLED-without-resource-receipt handling all pass. The autotest environment
also writes a recoverable base-game
`SCR_EditableEntityCore/GetPlayerIdentityId` VM exception to `crash.log` before
the HST case completes successfully, so the run is not exception-free.

This seals only source, Foundation, all-target Workbench, and focused engine
proof. Full Campaign Debug Phase 17 in `HST_Dev`, serialization/restart,
package/native/live-server behavior, migration runtime, marker runtime,
multiplayer/network/JIP/reconnect, and soak remain pending. The focused result is
not physical travel, native combat, capture, persistence, restart, or network
evidence.

## Preceding Schema-68 Checkpoint

The preceding planning checkpoint is Campaign Schema 68/runtime-settings Schema
24 at implementation
`4c9a94a1cb4811b6e75a7dca5dba70efffcb523d`, UTC
`2026-07-13T15:43:01Z`, label
`schema68-settings24-enemy-planning-engine-proof`. Production target selection
collapses linked same-faction order, support, and operation rows to stable roots,
rejects incompatible roots before ranking, retains compatible roots with bounded
penalties, and reranks duplicate-patrol choices. Preparation is freeze-only, and
admission revalidates authority before pressure or strategic debit, including
pressure-marked retries.

Foundation passes at 753 script-symbol references. Final stamped-tree all-target
Workbench log `logs_2026-07-13_11-43-49` compiles 5,816 Game files/11,770 classes
at CRC `5a998c21`; WORKBENCH, PC, XBOX, PS4, and PS5 report `Script validation
successful`, the run exited successfully, and zero Workbench processes survived
cleanup.
During sealing, log `logs_2026-07-13_11-41-09` first stopped at the HST blockers
`Formula too complex` and `Too many parameters for Format`. Factoring aggregate
booleans and splitting evidence formatting removed those blockers before the
final clean validation.

Focused engine log `logs_2026-07-13_11-44-28` then ran
`HST_TEST_EnemyPlanningCommitmentAuthority`. Its JUnit result at
`2026-07-13T15:44:34.667Z` records one testcase, no failure, an empty failed list,
and `AllExact=true` across all 17 deterministic Schema-68 planning fixtures,
including retry-quarantine repeated-pass idempotency. This focused proof did not
run Full Campaign Debug, `HST_Dev` coordinator isolation/artifacts, or live
campaign authority. Package, restart, dedicated-server, live-server,
multiplayer/network, and soak proof remain open.

The immediately preceding sealed source/Workbench checkpoint is the commitment-
aware planning seal at implementation
`695caf46ce6b4146e5407711b76d5e0c578d7392`, UTC
`2026-07-13T14:44:37Z`, label
`schema68-settings24-commitment-aware-enemy-planning`. Its final all-target
Workbench log `logs_2026-07-13_10-45-27` compiled 5,815 Game files/11,768 classes
at CRC `e483e71c`, with all five targets successful and zero surviving Workbench
processes. This is historical source/Workbench evidence superseded by the active
engine-proof seal above.

The earlier Schema-68/Settings-24 bootstrap/profile/marker correction is sealed
at implementation
`fdf262637e74a70c12454f6c1d3789c2cd0a0f05`, UTC
`2026-07-13T13:19:22Z`, label
`schema68-settings24-bootstrap-profile-marker-hardening`. The latest packaged
server test loaded the prior `f97b12e` build. It successfully created canonical
`$profile:Partisan` settings and campaign data, but no retired profile tree
existed, so recursive migration did not run.

That package exposed both configured enemy strategic pools and planning rows
quarantined at `-67`/`-68` on a fresh campaign. Enemy planning never became
executable, and the server emitted 598 unchanged unavailable warnings at roughly
one-second cadence. The preceding sealed source seeds exact fresh authority
before restored validation, preserves fail-closed handling for unrelated
restored corruption, recognizes only the complete known poisoned Schema-68
signature, and throttles unchanged warnings to 300-second reminders. The same
production bootstrap factory serves normal startup, admin reset, and fresh-state
proof. Recovery requires the exact nonempty preset identity, exact three-pool/
two-planner cardinality, no null rows, and empty strategic-mutation and enemy-
order arrays; resource, topology, preset, null-row, legacy-order, versioned-order,
and other near misses remain untouched. Live Campaign Debug observes actual
authority through read-only production exact-pool and exact-planner resolvers.

That checkpoint also adds staged and byte-verified whole-tree profile movement,
file/directory conflict archival, an explicit single-writer startup boundary,
and a destructive campaign-marker self-heal/player-marker isolation probe with
final repair/cleanup. Its final stamped-tree all-target Workbench log
`logs_2026-07-13_09-20-51` compiled 5,815 Game files/11,768 classes at CRC
`0544aa1d`; all five targets validated and zero Workbench processes survived
cleanup. Campaign Debug, package execution, packaged restart, actual migration,
dedicated-server, multiplayer, and soak proof for that checkpoint remain open.

The earlier sealed enemy-planning authority checkpoint is Campaign Schema 68
while runtime settings remains Schema 24. Its stamp identifies implementation
`356b0d47f96111c3b09eb7ede3cb34f0661c2b6e`, UTC
`2026-07-13T01:04:41Z`, label
`schema68-settings24-enemy-planning-authority`, Foundation 744, and Workbench CRC
`971d30d0`. The earlier Schema-67 resource checkpoint is implementation
`2798cb20b824ed74419ab6dc9bdce03f18ef71df`, UTC
`2026-07-12T23:46:02Z`, and label
`schema67-settings24-enemy-strategic-resource-authority`. Source work provides one
versioned `HST_FactionPoolState` per configured enemy and bounded replay-safe
`HST_EnemyStrategicMutationState` receipts for income, spend, refund, and
aggression. Exact replay must be read-only; fingerprint conflict and arithmetic
underflow/overflow must reject atomically; enemy roles must remain independent;
zero-effect operational commands must retain evidence; and exact QRF/patrol
debit-refund evidence must retain reciprocal receipt links. Each enemy owns
persisted cadence bucket checkpoints and a contiguous operational sequence.
Operational receipts never compact and stop at 4,096 per faction. Pre-67
migration adopts valid balances/aggression and legacy cadence only, invents no history,
spend, refund, order, or decision, and current malformed graphs quarantine at
`-67`.

Schema 67 passes Foundation at 736 script-symbol references. Final stamped normal
Workbench log `logs_2026-07-12_19-52-14` and all-five log
`logs_2026-07-12_19-52-36` both compile 5,809 Game files/11,751 classes at CRC
`a353fa0d`; all-five reports `Script validation successful` for WORKBENCH, PC,
XBOX, PS4, and PS5. Both runs have zero HST script errors, and zero Workbench
processes survived cleanup. Its core deterministic assertions are wired into
Campaign Debug but have not executed; no runtime matrix result exists.
Persisted planning cadence and frozen decision fingerprints were not part of
the Schema-67 seal; they are the sealed Schema-68 work described above. This
source/Workbench checkpoint does not certify
the still-open Blueprint Phase 8 native, save/restart, marker-input, package,
multiplayer, or soak gates.

An earlier sealed source/Workbench checkpoint advances to Campaign Schema 66 while runtime settings
remains Schema 24. The sealed Schema-66 stamp identifies implementation
`a7031797e67d99a99a066038cd8fa39efc03cff1`, UTC
`2026-07-12T20:28:33Z`, and label
`schema66-settings24-local-security-marker-integrity`. Source inspection shows one exact local-security patrol epoch
per eligible canonical enemy-held town: deterministic patrol/operation/manifest/
batch/group identity, an authored 2–5 member roster, strategic hold outside the
render bubble, casualty-preserving physical fold, restore to the same held
survivors, one police `-1` destruction receipt, no same-epoch resurrection, and
rearm only from a newer ownership revision or later positive police event.
Owner/pressure clear, setup/stop, and spawn failure settle without political
loss. Resistance automatic police and roadblock targets are zero. Pre-66
migration preserves logical security and garrison facts while removing only
unlinked disposable legacy police projections; malformed current graphs
quarantine at `-66`.

That sealed source also repairs the Schema-61 client-local campaign-marker owner
regression introduced at commit `27672e6`. Protected campaign markers now enter
native state as system-owned/non-removable records and a readiness keepalive
rebuilds missing or mutated native projection from the committed client registry.
Player-created/dynamic markers remain separately editable. Foundation passes at
729 script-symbol references. Final stamped normal/all-five Workbench checks pass
at 5,806 Game files/11,740 classes with CRC `ec860be7`, `Script validation
successful`, zero HST script errors, and zero surviving processes. The
deterministic Campaign Debug proof, native marker-input result, package, save/
restart, multiplayer, and soak evidence remain open.

The previous sealed source/Workbench checkpoint is Campaign Schema 65/runtime-
settings Schema 24. It identifies implementation
`609add9eeadf73816764c497178e2d35081307d1`, UTC
`2026-07-12T18:30:29Z`, and label
`schema65-settings24-civilian-consequence-authority`. Source inspection shows exact canonical-
town casualty, resistance theft, and real-combat episode commands; aggression
target/delta/before/after evidence with a matching strategic receipt; persisted
danger/adopted-floor/last-applied episode authority; and pedestrian panic/
recovery. Final stamped normal Workbench compile/create and all-five validation
are clean at 5,802 Game files/11,728 classes with CRC `c0a672b9`; all-five
reports `Script validation successful`, both runs exited `0`, zero HST script
errors were observed, and zero Workbench processes survived cleanup. The
preceding unstamped CRC `be076102` remains preliminary evidence only. The post-
documentation Foundation passes at 717 script-symbol references;
Campaign Debug, native, package, real-profile/process-restart, multiplayer, and
soak evidence remain open. This checkpoint must be reported only under its exact
Schema-65 identity above.

The previous sealed campaign source/Workbench checkpoint is Campaign Schema 64
on runtime-settings Schema 24. It identifies implementation
`6afadc7c13681b78171939a740862e52328beffd`, UTC
`2026-07-12T15:57:55Z`, and label
`schema64-settings24-ambient-runtime-authority`. It keeps campaign persistence
at Schema 64 and moves runtime settings from Schema 23 to 24 for the Blueprint
Phase 8 ambient-runtime slice.
Global actor/traffic caps, leased fair allocation, bounded root scheduling,
asynchronous readiness admission, immutable projection slots, bounded slot-
specific recovery, per-frame player-first claim observation, and fail-closed
transient-versus-claimed vehicle persistence are source-complete. Foundation
passes at 711 script-symbol references. Stamped-tree normal Workbench compilation
and all-five-configuration validation pass at 5,799 files/11,718 classes with CRC
`bb083672`, successful validation, zero HST script errors, and zero surviving
Workbench processes. Pure allocator/lifecycle/save-boundary fixtures do not
prove native groups, seating, engine start, waypoint activation, movement,
recovery, or recycling. Campaign Debug, packaged server/client execution, native
brief enter/exit, autosave/restart, promoted-root destruction, new-campaign
reset, Campaign Debug Phase 20 production-path execution, rendered UI, and the
ten-town/ten-minute stutter/churn/performance soak are pending.

Campaign Schema 64/runtime-settings Schema 23 is the preceding sealed canonical-
town-influence checkpoint. It identifies implementation
`6f3c913eaed66926cce38b2ecafcff94084898a3`, UTC
`2026-07-12T11:28:41Z`, and label `schema64-canonical-town-influence`.

Schema 63 is an earlier sealed source/Workbench checkpoint. It identifies implementation
`85a75c65e9c148a890d8d78b0288ae6483a5ccd9`, UTC
`2026-07-12T08:22:05Z`, and label
`schema63-canonical-combat-presence`.

Schema 62 is an earlier sealed canonical-ownership checkpoint under implementation
`7c93e0a485bcabe5a364c0b0cfeca235accb50f7`, UTC
`2026-07-12T06:11:19Z`, and label
`schema62-canonical-ownership-transition`. Foundation passes with 670 script-
symbol references. Headless Workbench Game validation loaded 5,785 files/11,652
classes with CRC `22c13a32` and zero script errors; the normal Script Editor open
remained responsive without a crash, and zero Workbench processes survived the
test. Schema 61 is the preceding sealed marker-projection foundation. No Schema-
62 Campaign Debug or packaged-runtime result has been recorded.

## Current Source/Workbench Checkpoint And Runtime Boundary

The opening bullets distinguish the current sealed source/Workbench tree from
the previous packaged evidence. Later runtime entries retain inspected gameplay
evidence and must not be read as proof that a newer source change was executed or
certified. The revision diary below is historical implementation context.

Work has entered Blueprint Phase 9 of 13 through sealed Schema 67 and the sealed
Schema-68 planning, startup/profile/marker, commitment-aware planning, and
enemy-planning engine-proof checkpoints; this is not nine completed phases.
Blueprint Phase 8 and every
earlier Blueprint phase still retain native, dedicated-server, restart, or
multiplayer exit gates. Deferred native tests must be backfilled; reaching a
later source slice, sealing source, or publishing a build does not waive them.

### Current Sealed Schema-68 Enemy-Planning Engine-Proof Checkpoint

- Target scoring now examines same-faction queued/active enemy orders and support
  plus open nonterminal operations at equivalent target IDs before weighted
  ranking. Linked order/support/operation rows collapse to one identity,
  preferring the order ID and then operation ID. Terminal and rival-faction rows
  do not block the current faction.
- Incompatible commander commitments remove the zone from the candidate set.
  Exact patrol and independent non-commander operation roots remain compatible
  and apply `-12` per collapsed root, capped at `-24`. The final order-type check
  permits a defensive response alongside the exact patrol. A duplicate patrol
  candidate is excluded and the remaining candidates are deterministically
  reranked. Orphan support and unlinked patrol/QRF operations block the target;
  a root with mixed compatible/blocking rows receives one blocking classification.
  Candidate diagnostics record commitment rejection count/reason and compatible
  count/penalty; the candidate fingerprint advances to `ept2_` and includes those
  fields.
- New periodic-decision preparation is freeze-only. Admission rechecks the
  commitment fingerprint, target candidate fingerprint, source set, and active-
  order compatibility before applying target pressure, then reaches strategic
  debit only afterward. Commitment identity is also rechecked on a pressure-
  marked retry before debit. A post-freeze commitment race rejects without
  pressure, debit, order creation, or rival-planner mutation. If every target is
  incompatibly committed, the production path completes an explicit zero-cost
  `skipped` decision with no target/source or side effects.
- Campaign Debug adds `enemy_planning.commitment_aware_selection`,
  `enemy_planning.all_committed_skip`, and
  `enemy_planning.commitment_race_rejection`. Their production-path fixtures
  cover linked-root collapse, blocked-target fallback, permutation-stable
  candidate identity/rejection diagnostics, production duplicate-patrol rerank,
  queued and equivalent-ID filtering, settled/terminal/rival ignores, mixed-root
  blocking precedence, orphan behavior, all-target exhaustion, and pre-pressure
  plus pressure-marked freeze/admission races.
- Official focused engine autotest
  `HST_TEST_EnemyPlanningCommitmentAuthority` executed the authority report in
  log `logs_2026-07-13_11-44-28`. JUnit UTC
  `2026-07-13T15:44:34.667Z` records one testcase, no failure, and an empty
  failed list. The report returned `AllExact=true` across all 17 deterministic
  Schema-68 planning fixtures, including retry-quarantine repeated-pass
  idempotency.
- Workbench log `logs_2026-07-13_11-41-09` first failed at the HST blockers
  `Formula too complex` and `Too many parameters for Format`. Factoring aggregate
  booleans and splitting evidence formatting removed both blockers.
- The checkpoint is sealed at implementation
  `4c9a94a1cb4811b6e75a7dca5dba70efffcb523d`, UTC
  `2026-07-13T15:43:01Z`, label
  `schema68-settings24-enemy-planning-engine-proof`. Foundation passes at 753
  references. Final stamped-tree all-target Workbench log
  `logs_2026-07-13_11-43-49` compiles 5,816 Game files/11,770 classes at CRC
  `5a998c21`; WORKBENCH, PC, XBOX, PS4, and PS5 validate successfully, the run
  exited successfully, and zero Workbench processes survived cleanup. The
  focused autotest did
  not enter Full Campaign Debug in `HST_Dev`; coordinator isolation/artifacts and
  live-authority assertions have not run. No packaged campaign, restart,
  dedicated-server, live-server, multiplayer/network, or soak artifact proves
  this checkpoint yet.

### Sealed Schema-68 Startup/Profile/Marker Correction

- Fresh-state construction installs configured strategic pools and idle planning
  baselines through the same production factory used by normal startup, admin
  reset, and deterministic fresh proof before `RestoreOrCreateCampaignState()`
  can return that fallback to current-schema validators. Persisted data still
  replaces the arrays first, so missing, duplicate, foreign, or malformed
  restored authority remains quarantined rather than being recreated by
  foundation repair.
- Known-state recovery requires the full observed generated signature: restored
  Schema 68; exact nonempty preset identity; exactly three non-null pools
  containing a neutral resistance row and
  one untouched `-67` row per configured enemy; exactly two untouched `-68`
  planner rows; and completely empty strategic-mutation and enemy-order arrays.
  It restores configured balances and an idle baseline at the current elapsed
  second. Resource, topology, preset, null-row, legacy-order, versioned-order, and every
  other near miss remain unchanged. The fixture additionally requires unrelated-
  state preservation, one-shot idempotence, validator acceptance, and exact save
  roundtrip.
- Planner-unavailable reporting is independent of planner cadence. First,
  changed, and recovery transitions report immediately; an unchanged failure is
  suppressed until a 300-second reminder.
- Campaign Debug adds fresh-bootstrap, warning-throttle, and actual live-authority
  assertions. Live authority calls the same read-only exact pool and planner
  resolvers used by production, then separately requires exactly three pools, two
  planners, one neutral resistance pool, and no null pool row. It creates no
  receipt and mutates no campaign authority while observing it. The exact
  poisoned-save and near-miss recovery fixtures remain required proof before
  runtime closure.
- The new enemy assertion IDs are `enemy_planning.fresh_bootstrap`,
  `enemy_planning.unavailable_log_throttle`, `enemy_planning.live_authority`,
  `enemy_planning.bootstrap_recovery_exact`,
  `enemy_planning.bootstrap_recovery_rejection`, and
  `enemy_planning.bootstrap_recovery_roundtrip`.
- Startup profile migration enumerates the complete retired tree before server or
  local-client consumers. Files first move to a unique verified stage, recheck
  their canonical/archive destination before promotion, compare byte-for-byte at
  the final destination, and only then lose their source. Directory conflicts are
  mirrored under the archive; directories are removed deepest first and
  completion requires the retired root to be absent. A same-process guard blocks
  re-entry. Because Enforce has no atomic cross-process promotion or exclusive
  lock, runtime proof must use exactly one profile startup writer.
- The owner-client marker proof mutates and deletes one protected tracked marker,
  invokes the production repair path after each fault, and requires system
  ownership, non-removability, registry/static-count stability, and one canonical
  instance. It always retries final production repair, then separately creates,
  edits, removes, and cleanup-rechecks an ordinary player marker.
- The new marker assertion IDs are `map_ui.campaign_marker.system_owned`,
  `map_ui.campaign_marker.non_removable`,
  `map_ui.campaign_marker.mutation_self_heal`,
  `map_ui.campaign_marker.delete_self_heal`,
  `map_ui.campaign_marker.registry_stable`,
  `map_ui.campaign_marker.single_instance`, and
  `map_ui.player_marker.editable_isolation`.
- This subsection passes Foundation and all-target Workbench validation. Campaign
  Debug and packaged restart/migration/marker tests have not executed.

### Sealed Schema-67 Source Delta

- Campaign schema advances to 67; runtime-settings remains 24. The sealed source
  identity is `2798cb20b824ed74419ab6dc9bdce03f18ef71df`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T23:46:02Z`, label
  `schema67-settings24-enemy-strategic-resource-authority`. Foundation passes at
  736 references. Final normal/all-five Workbench checks pass at 5,809 Game files/
  11,751 classes with CRC `a353fa0d`; all-five validates WORKBENCH, PC, XBOX, PS4,
  and PS5 successfully, with zero HST script errors and zero surviving Workbench
  processes.
- One versioned `HST_FactionPoolState` owns attack resources, support resources,
  aggression, resource-income/aggression-decay accumulators and last-bucket
  checkpoints, plus a contiguous operational count for exactly one configured
  enemy role. Occupier and invader state, receipt chains, caps, and cadences remain
  isolated.
- One server strategic-mutation API owns every enemy income, spend, refund,
  aggression, and live admin/debug adjustment. No live consumer writes pool
  values directly; bootstrap/copy and isolated fixture construction are not live
  mutation paths.
- Each accepted mutation appends a bounded
  `HST_EnemyStrategicMutationState` receipt that freezes stable identity,
  contract/applied state, enemy faction, mutation kind/amount, before/after values,
  per-faction operational sequence, source, campaign second, and any required
  order/operation/accounting links. A zero-effect operational command still
  appends a durable receipt and consumes one sequence value.
  Exact replay returns the retained result without mutation; changed-fingerprint
  identity reuse, invalid role, underflow, overflow, cap exhaustion, or backlink
  conflict changes no pool value or revision. A fingerprint conflict may
  quarantine authority metadata; it is not described as a read-only diagnostic.
- Existing exact defensive-QRF and enemy-patrol operation, force, and settlement
  contracts remain unchanged. Their attack/support debits, rejected-admission
  refunds, and survivor refunds must point at canonical receipts so replay and
  restart cannot duplicate a charge or refund. Unsupported order families
  retain explicit legacy/deferred lifecycles, but their post-67 resource or
  aggression mutations still enter the canonical API. Current restore validates
  reciprocal order mutation IDs and faction/operation/manifest/zone facts, a
  unique defense support ledger, and typed town-influence/ownership-transition
  source rows.
- Pre-67 migration adopts each valid enemy pool's current attack, support,
  aggression, and valid legacy resource/aggression cadence accumulators as the
  baseline, initializes matching last-bucket checkpoints, and starts with no synthesized mutation
  history. It never reconstructs spend/refunds from older balances or invents an
  order, settlement, target choice, or planning decision. Current malformed
  pool/receipt authority quarantines at `-67` and cannot fall back.
- Invalid, orphaned, rejected-role, and prior `-67` receipt rows are attributed
  and quarantined before purge. They are not accepted replay evidence and cannot
  consume either enemy role's valid operational capacity.
- Mission success/failure/expiry builds and deep-copy-preflights its full direct
  and deferred strategic mutation plan, admits the live strategic result, and
  only then publishes terminal mission state, rewards, capture, or cleanup.
  Rejected expiry remains active under an explicit pending phase and retries on
  later ticks. Ownership aggression admission likewise precedes destructive
  security/support reconciliation and owner/revision publication.
  Mission terminal strategic-event IDs derive from outcome kind plus mission
  instance and do not advance the shared authority sequence. Threshold-crossing
  capture preflights the exact shared ownership request and deferred aggression
  command before any direct receipt; a rejected ownership admission changes no
  reward, capture progress, event, receipt, sequence, or mission status.
- State-only enemy support/order and mission success/failure debug cases run on
  nested disposable campaign clones. Mission outcomes still call the production
  coordinator `CompleteMission()`/`FailMission()` wrappers, then compare an exact
  enclosing-state strategic-authority fingerprint so receipt, pool-revision, or
  operational-count leakage cannot false-pass as successful fixture cleanup. The
  physical-response case uses focused one-request/one-group service calls,
  materializes only that supplied group, and cleans its root, vehicle, waypoints,
  pending population, and route progress while restoring marker flags and the
  AIWorld limit. These are isolation guards, not native runtime proof.
- `HST_EnemyStrategicResourceProofService` is registered for deterministic legacy
  adoption, replay/conflict including zero-effect receipts, atomic arithmetic,
  income catch-up/contribution fingerprints, attack-versus-support separation,
  rival/cap isolation, aggression-versus-war-level independence, roundtrip, and
  `-67` quarantine. Exact QRF and patrol proof suites also assert reciprocal
  mutation IDs. Static gates own state/save symmetry, cadence checkpoint and hard-
  cap structure, cross-domain backlinks, and targeted live-write rejection. None
  has a final Campaign Debug artifact or runtime result yet.
- Operational receipts are not a retention archive. At 4,096 accepted
  operational receipts, later operational admission fails for that faction; no
  terminal compaction or eviction exists in Schema 67. Compact periodic receipts
  and the rival faction remain independent.
- Sealed Schema 68 persists the independent per-enemy cadence,
  stable sorted inputs, and frozen target/source/order/cost/pressure/accounting
  decision fingerprint. Its prior source/Workbench seal is historical evidence;
  the current bootstrap correction has no Workbench, Campaign Debug, restart,
  package, or runtime result yet.

### Sealed Schema-66 Source/Workbench Delta

- Campaign schema advances to 66; runtime-settings remains 24. No generated-
  settings migration is introduced.
- `HST_LocalSecurityCatalogService` accepts only the configured authored enemy
  town-police group, validates the root and ordered member prefabs, and freezes
  police-strength-plus-one at 2–5 members. Resistance and non-town/noncanonical
  candidates fail closed.
- `HST_LocalSecurityOperationService` admits at most four new town epochs per
  tick, but never more than one authority graph per town. The deterministic ID
  includes town, faction, canonical ownership revision, and epoch. Admission
  produces one frozen manifest, open typed operation, held SpawnQueue batch, and
  exact active-group roster.
- An inactive town keeps the exact member slots in strategic hold. An active
  town releases the same slots through the exact infantry adapter and uses a
  process-local cyclic waypoint chain. Deactivation reconciles mapped deaths,
  validates exact runtime bindings, retires native ownership, and requeues only
  survivors. Restore clears process handles and returns pending/physical state
  to held virtual authority. No route is persisted and neither fold nor restore
  refills casualties.
- Complete roster destruction retires runtime authority, applies exactly one
  `local_security_patrol_destroyed` town event with police `-1` and zero other
  effects, and settles terminal `DESTROYED`. Replay is idempotent. Remaining
  positive police pressure cannot reopen that epoch; rearm requires a newer
  ownership revision or a later applied positive police event.
- Owner change, police-pressure clear, setup, campaign terminal, and spawn
  failure use non-loss settlement. Ownership preflight blocks on ambiguous or
  quarantined local-security authority and retires/reconciles the exact old graph
  before publishing the new owner. Persistence applies the same physical-
  authority barrier and defers capture on unresolved fold/binding state.
- Resistance-held towns drift automatic police and roadblock pressure to zero.
  The separate at-most-two aggregate resistance infantry policy remains in the
  ownership service and is not civilian-police authority.
- Pre-66 migration clears patrol backlinks and removes only disposable legacy
  police active-group rows without exact/mission/support/garrison links. It
  preserves logical police, roadblock, owner, support, and garrison facts and
  invents no roster, casualty, operation, fold credit, or refund. One migration
  event records the count. Current reciprocal graph or loss-receipt corruption
  quarantines at `-66` and is isolated from generic cleanup/combat presence.
- `HST_LocalSecurityOperationProofService` covers authored roster bounds,
  admission replay, enemy-town eligibility, survivor fold/restore/no refill,
  destruction replay, non-loss owner/stop/spawn settlement, owner-revision rearm,
  and conflict quarantine. It is wired into the force-integrity Campaign Debug
  case but has not run and creates no native proof.
- The marker repair addresses the `27672e6` regression directly. A protected
  client-local static campaign marker bypasses stock local-owner assignment,
  stays owner `-1` with owner removal disabled, and records a live integrity
  signature. Readiness keepalive checks missing/deleted or position/text/icon/
  flag/owner/removal drift and reconciles from the committed registry. Player-
  created/dynamic markers remain editable and outside this repair.
- Open gates: Campaign Debug, native roster and cyclic waypoint behavior, live casualties and bubble fold/
  re-entry, real persistence/process restart, ownership transition, terminal
  cleanup, manual marker delete/move/edit and self-heal, packaged dedicated
  server/client, multiplayer/reconnect/JIP, balance, and soak.

### Previous Sealed Schema-65 Source/Workbench Checkpoint

- The campaign schema advances to 65 while runtime-settings remains 24. The exact
  checkpoint is implementation `609add9eeadf73816764c497178e2d35081307d1`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T18:30:29Z`, and label
  `schema65-settings24-civilian-consequence-authority`; Schema 64/settings 24 is
  the previous sealed checkpoint.
- `OnControllableDestroyed` admits only a tracked ambient pedestrian or traffic
  driver. It retains the observation for a 256-row casualty queue; deferred theft
  has a separate 64-row queue. The queues share a maximum of four attempted
  consequence transactions per frame before player-first claims and persistence.
  Rejected rows retry indefinitely with bounded 5/10/15-second backoff, while
  capacity exhaustion retains the observation and pending authority defers
  capture. Actor-local observed/receipt evidence also fences the health-tick
  dead-character fallback. Native callback attribution, queue retry, process
  interruption, capture deferral, and no-double-loss behavior remain unexecuted.
- Player-first claim observation promotes a live civilian vehicle to exact
  durable `field_vehicle` authority before a resistance theft event is derived
  from that durable runtime ID. Only an exact player pilot can claim; a passenger
  protects the transient root from budget/health recycling until exit or an
  exact pilot claim, but cannot promote it or produce theft. Non-resistance
  claims and military ambience do not produce theft.
  Native claim order and replay across save/restart remain unproven.
- Canonical town events may now carry one enemy aggression target, bounded
  positive delta, and aggression before/after values. Admission requires unique
  target-pool authority, headroom, injected economy/strategic services, and no
  pre-existing source claim. Restore requires one unique applied
  `town_influence` strategic receipt matching the source event, target faction,
  target zone, timestamp, and delta. Static fixtures are wired for once-only
  replay, conflict, overflow, duplicate-pool/source, stable-ID exhaustion, and
  persistence cases, but have not executed in Campaign Debug.
- Nearby-combat influence is episode-based. A zone's persisted contract-`1`
  envelope carries the last combat-presence revision, danger state, episode
  count, adopted Schema-64 baseline floor, last-applied episode receipt,
  transition time, panic deadline, last consequence event, and authority
  failure. The floor is `0..1`, `episode - lastApplied <= 1`, and a pending
  episode receipt must drain before a new edge. At least one current operation
  or recent-fire fact is required; `HOT` alone is intentionally inert. A
  canonical-town edge can append at most one political event. Clear and rebound
  behavior remains native-runtime-open.
- Current restore accepts each live canonical-town combat receipt only when its
  complete fingerprint is canonical: heat `+4`; zero support, reputation,
  population, police, roadblock, and aggression deltas; source equal to event ID;
  exact nearby-combat reason; and unchanged support/population before/after.
- An admitted pedestrian can remain behavior-ready while `Panicked`. Native
  `EAIThreatState` or locality danger replaces wander helpers with one move
  waypoint away from the threat and requests RUN. Calm transitions through
  bounded `Recovering`, restores deterministic wander helpers at WALK, and
  returns to `Wandering` only after waypoint acknowledgement. Panic route loss/
  stall uses a separate bounded counter, and this hot path does not reactivate
  AI. The pure lifecycle proof is wired, but native threat detection, movement,
  speed, rebound, and recovery have not run. Traffic panic is outside this slice.
- Political population remains independent of physical actor count. Canonical
  towns receive exact population/support/heat/aggression consequences even when
  no ambient actor is rendered; minor localities remain panic-only and create no
  town or strategic event. Their bounded event-fingerprint map is session-only,
  so cross-process minor-locality replay/conflict identity is explicitly not
  certified.
- Restore order is dependency-sensitive: town event/aggression shape first;
  combat physical-sample invalidation; ownership and marker normalization; town
  pending-owner/strategic-receipt validation; then Schema-65 locality-envelope
  migration/quarantine. Bounded influence/strategic indexes validate exact live-
  town backlinks and structural pool/arithmetic/receipt facts. Because preset
  faction roles are not serialized, a separate post-restore live-preset pass
  quarantines any aggression target that is not a configured enemy. Pre-65
  events receive empty/zero aggression evidence. Malformed town/strategic
  authority quarantines at `-64`; malformed danger/episode/panic/backlink
  authority quarantines at `-65` and clears active danger. No restore path
  replays a consequence.
- Final stamped normal Workbench compile/create and all-five validation loaded
  5,802 Game files/11,728 classes with CRC `c0a672b9`; all-five reported `Script
  validation successful`, both runs exited `0`, zero HST script errors were
  observed, and zero Workbench processes survived cleanup. The post-documentation
  Foundation passes at 717 script-symbol references. Remaining gates are Campaign Debug fixture execution, packaged native callback/
  threat/movement behavior, real profile save/restart, rendered observation,
  dedicated multiplayer, and the ten-town/ten-minute stutter/churn/performance
  soak.

### Previous Sealed Ambient Source/Workbench Checkpoint

- The previous Blueprint Phase 8 ambient-runtime checkpoint is sealed in source/
  Workbench only at implementation
  `6afadc7c13681b78171939a740862e52328beffd`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T15:57:55Z`, and label
  `schema64-settings24-ambient-runtime-authority`. Campaign persistence
  deliberately remains Schema 64; only runtime settings advance from Schema 23
  to 24. Foundation passes at 711 script-symbol references. Stamped-tree Workbench
  compilation and explicit validation for all five configurations pass at
  5,799 files/11,718 classes and CRC `bb083672`, with successful validation,
  zero HST script errors, and zero surviving Workbench processes.
- The ambient allocator now applies global actor and traffic caps, player-count
  additions, war-level pressure, deterministic fair rotation, and leases of at
  least 120 seconds. A separate reconciliation cursor prevents the same town
  from always receiving first admission. Each health update permits at most four
  root-spawn transactions, including initial static civilian and military roots.
  Five traffic vehicles is the configurable daytime/low-heat town default only
  when population and the global budget permit; it is not a fixed ceiling or an
  unconditional per-town guarantee. Combined pedestrian/driver demand is capped
  to the unique valid appearance pool, and exhaustion fails closed rather than
  cloning an actor already visible in the locality.
- A pedestrian is admitted only after its exact living CIV character is in its
  one-member helper group and its wander waypoint is active. Traffic admission
  requires the exact driver as pilot of the usable vehicle, the engine running,
  and an active route. Request acceptance is not treated as native readiness.
  Immutable per-zone/kind projection slots and original seeds drive bounded
  startup, distinct recovery routes, retry, recycle, and diagnostics state.
  Static military ambience now detects owner or policy-key changes, promotes
  player claims, recycles unclaimed stale roots, and repopulates through the
  same transaction cap. The scoped Campaign Debug Phase 20 helper now selects its
  town from the production global plan and shares the four-root transaction-
  start cap.
- Routine session topology and movement sampling do not dirty the campaign save.
  Unclaimed ambient runtime rows and their cargo are filtered at save/restore;
  claimed vehicles persist as field vehicles, and legacy detached ambient claims
  migrate through the same durable field-vehicle boundary. Player-first
  observation avoids a full ambient-root occupancy scan before persistence every
  server frame and accepts only live roots with live controlled occupants. Every
  `HST_PersistenceService` capture/checkpoint path repeats reconciliation, as does
  new-campaign reset. One tracker registers promotions, restored/adopted field
  vehicles, and garage redeploys for current transform, destruction, and cargo
  position. It resolves an exact registered binding first, permits a unique same-
  prefab root within 8 meters only for initial/recovery binding, and fails closed
  on ambiguity. Saved durable IDs do not rekey to process-local replication IDs;
  restore/registration precedes first-frame claim observation, and loot/garage/
  undercover lookups use exact forward/reverse bindings. Garage redeploy creates
  and tracks a fresh campaign-stable ID before payment/stored-row removal and
  rolls back root/row/cargo/binding on failure. Reset can retain occupied live tracked `loot_vehicle`,
  `field_vehicle`, and `garage_redeploy` roots, normalizes them to `field_vehicle`,
  and copies their vehicle/cargo state before replacing campaign state. Native
  brief enter/exit, autosave/restart, destruction, reset, the two-nearby-same-
  prefab no-collapse case, and Campaign Debug Phase 20 execution still require
  proof.
- The ambient budget, actor-lifecycle, settings-migration, and save-boundary proof
  services are pure deterministic kernels. They do not demonstrate native group
  membership, faction propagation, waypoint activation, pilot seating, engine
  start, route activation, movement, recovery, recycling, serialization, or
  restart. The ambient Campaign Debug cases have not run. A packaged server run,
  real save/restart, and a ten-town/ten-minute performance/churn/stutter soak are
  required before this slice can be runtime-certified. Commander aid and ownership/security-
  pressure paths exist but need runtime proof. Automatic civilian consequences
  and exact local security were not part of this older seal; Schemas 65 and 66
  implement those later source slices without retroactively certifying them.
- Sealed Schema 64 makes one unique contract-`1`
  `HST_TownInfluenceRecord` the sole political support/population truth for each
  curated town. FIA, occupier, and invader support are separate basis-point
  values; legacy zone/civilian support and population are projections only.
  The pinned formula commit is
  `6e4226d3863ca8673535386c2fff8b6e08a806c4`, with raw `+1` at populations
  100/25/400 producing `+100`/`+200`/`+50` basis points. FIA must be strictly
  above `8000` for resistance ownership or strictly below `4000` for enemy
  ownership; equality does not cross a boundary. Every flip delegates to
  `HST_OwnershipTransitionService`. This is source inspection, not runtime proof.
- Pre-64 normalization reconciles legacy signed zone support and civilian pairs
  once, preserves population, and does not replay old events. Current duplicate,
  missing, orphaned, malformed, inconsistent, or event-linked authority
  quarantines at `-64`. Simon's Wood remains ambient-only, and the Maiden's Bay
  Logistics Warehouse remains nonpolitical.
- New source assertions cover scaling, strict thresholds, event replay/revision,
  legacy projection, ordinary population movement, exact arbitrary-basis-point
  absolute support/population seed replay and conflict rejection under an
  invader owner, current-save population/aggregate tamper quarantine, invalid target rejection,
  unavailable ownership authority, external ownership completion, contacted-
  town filtering, current-first/support ordering, complete deterministic
  territory, invalid authority exclusion, and deferred-parent publication.
  None has executed in Campaign Debug.
- The preceding Schema-64/settings-23 canonical-town checkpoint's repository-
  side Foundation gate passes at 696 script-symbol references,
  including its dedicated Schema-64 contract checks. Normal Workbench
  compilation and explicit validation for all five configurations pass with the
  Game module at 5,793 files/11,695 classes and CRC `36d5b017`; validation
  reported success and no HST script errors. All Workbench processes were
  closed after each run and the post-run count was explicitly zero. This is
  source/compile/validation evidence, not Campaign Debug or gameplay evidence.
- Map/War Zone Pressure now projects only explicitly contacted canonical towns,
  places the current eligible town first, and sorts the remainder by FIA support
  and stable name/ID ties. Resistance Territory emits the full published
  resistance-owned strategic set in deterministic type/name/ID order and uses
  the same completed-parent publication fence as campaign markers. Radio and
  security drift alone do not mark contact.
- The town-influence hot path updates aggregates at mutation time and scans event
  history only for a town whose persisted next expiry is due. Changed active-
  group survivor/count diagnostics are throttled to 30 seconds. These are source
  stutter mitigations; no new server profile exists.
- Sealed Schema 63 adds one shared `HST_CombatPresenceService` instance to
  capture, MissionRuntime, HQ threat, civilian safety, and enemy-command
  decisions. It consumes fresh registered physical samples or eligible durable
  virtual infantry and never treats an abstract/empty vehicle count as living
  pressure. Physical classification requires a conscious character and counts
  dismounted infantry, each operational occupied armed mobile platform once, or
  each operational occupied static weapon once. Cargo, empty vehicles,
  destroyed/burning platforms, immobile mobile platforms, stale samples, and
  terminal/quarantined rows are rejected. This is source inspection, not a
  runtime observation.
- A spawned group with unresolved physical authority invalidates the affected
  result, so capture/safety consumers block or choose their documented
  conservative result. Zone capture separately requires a living conscious
  character player and excludes spectator cameras, Game Master proxies, and
  other non-character controlled entities.
- The coordinator refreshes native registered-member samples before
  MissionRuntime queries. The shared service builds one eligible-contribution
  cache per state/elapsed second and reuses authority-gap and zone/radius result
  caches. The physical sampler keeps an indexed runtime registry and reusable
  member/platform/agent buffers. Mission, support, enemy-order, and physical-
  projection mutations invalidate these snapshots, and the final physical
  invalidation is rebuilt for zone heat before capture. This source ordering
  addresses a new zones-by-groups-by-consumers one-second multiplier, but a
  normal Workbench compile/open is not profiling evidence and no packaged server
  measurement exists yet.
- Zones now persist revisioned `HOT -> COOLING -> COLD` diagnostics. Cooling
  retains its 30-second default in runtime-settings Schema 24, begins once when
  live presence clears, does not extend on stable ticks, blocks capture until
  expiry, and does not dirty persistence merely for a freshness timestamp.
  Physical zone projection separately enters at the activation radius and exits
  at the larger deactivation radius.
- The new Campaign Debug source assertions are
  `combat_presence.aggregate`, `.empty_vehicle`, `.authoritative_samples`,
  `.rejected_rows`, `.heat_lifecycle`, `.schema62_migration`,
  `.schema63_restore`, `.malformed_fail_cold`, and
  `.deterministic_diagnostics`. The restore fixture invalidates process-local
  samples, migrates pre-63 state to `COLD`, preserves valid current cooling and
  bounded diagnostics, and makes malformed current authority fail `COLD`. None
  of these assertions has executed in Campaign Debug yet, and the state-only
  fixture does not prove native seat, damage, movement, cache, serialization, or
  process-restart behavior.
- Schema 62 now provides one canonical ownership-transition source path for
  military capture, mission capture, political support, admin, debug seed, and
  migration repair. Its deterministic proof covers capture, bidirectional
  political flips, recapture, replay/conflict/stale rejection, interrupted
  restore, protocol-2 marker source revision, co-located identities, nested
  parent-owned publication, staged full-marker rollback, resolver fail-close,
  setup no-marker history through activation, exact support target/prefix and
  derived receipt correlation corruption, persistence deadline/re-arm, all cause
  routes, non-patrol/orphan/late exact-security fail-close,
  migration/quarantine, and retention. Those assertions have not yet run in a
  Campaign Debug or packaged server/client session.
- Accepted ownership work has an explicit durable checklist. Exact patrol and
  aggregate security retirement, hostile-runtime cleanup, new security, and
  frozen support consequences precede the owner/revision write. Later town,
  generated-site/facility/logistics, retaliation, economy/outcome, event,
  projection, notification, and persistence steps resume from the receipt.
  Supported zone aliases canonicalize before fingerprint/replay. Parent captures
  own publication for any nested political town flip. Later
  valid top-level requests are now admitted as pristine accepted/needs-retry
  receipts and execute in array order before any domain mutation. Exact mission,
  political, admin, and migration intent therefore survives the fence and
  restart. Every later unresolved top-level follower must remain pristine;
  pre-owner status alone is not valid restore authority. A live packaged save/
  restart test must still prove the retry boundary
  and that no intermediate owner/marker state escapes.
- An earlier parent's exact linked-town support event still records its one
  influence fact when a later pristine receipt owns that town backlink. Only
  political threshold reconciliation defers; the periodic civilian pass resumes
  it after FIFO ownership work drains.
- Current source keeps command-menu control counts, labels, tones, capture rows,
  and income on resolver-first published authority during retry. A retained
  marker only corroborates exact resolved owner/source revision; it cannot lead
  resolution or authorize ownership. Unsafe marker rows quarantine/purge.
  Parent publication snapshots the full logical marker array plus epoch/sequence,
  stages and validates every exact child receipt-zone-marker chain, releases all
  children, and commits only afterward. Failure restores the exact full snapshot.
  Setup publication instead persists immutable
  `m_bSetupProjectionWithoutMarkers` receipt history that
  remains historical after active marker rebuild. Production and proof use the
  same logical snapshot builder. Restore permits serialized queues only while
  every later unresolved follower is
  pristine, and quarantines multiple owner-applied
  publishers or an owner-applied publisher behind earlier unresolved top-level
  authority, rejects unrelated forged projection children and duplicate
  completed zone/applied-revision claims, and propagates parent quarantine
  iteratively. Restore also recomputes the exact sorted support-target set of
  linked towns plus every town within 1,500 m,
  requires applied targets to be its ordered prefix and each to match the same
  single deterministic influence row/deltas, and validates bounded reason,
  garrison, counterattack/order, strategic/campaign event, marker, and setup-mode
  correlations. These boundaries still require packaged/rendered/restart
  observation.
- If exact resolver authority is unavailable, source projection reports
  publication unavailable rather than exposing a prior/raw owner. Explicit-ID
  command reconstruction reuses frozen preconditions only after semantic request
  identity matches. Ownership-specific strategic events exclude unrelated global
  deltas accumulated while queued/retrying and record exact owner before/after,
  capture progress, and receipt aggression.
- Cause policies are not flattened by the shared service. Military/mission
  capture retains enemy retaliation. Admin changes reconcile security and notify
  without retaliation; debug seed also suppresses notification; migration repair
  preserves security and suppresses retaliation/notification. Runtime evidence
  must verify those no-op decisions as well as applied effects. Admission and
  current-save normalization enforce the cause flags, and admission rejects a
  revision that cannot safely advance into valid serialized authority.
- Admin capture and progress reports now distinguish accepted-pending ownership
  from rejection. Ownership retry runs in setup and terminal phases despite the
  frozen campaign clock. Invalid-owner migration reconciles restored receipts
  first, then scans sequentially every five seconds, deferring accepted/transient
  work and quarantining only structural or manual-repair cases. Runtime and
  restore retry preserve an already-recorded concrete receipt/zone quarantine
  reason rather than replacing it with generic retry text. Maintenance runs
  ownership retry and then town policy before setup/terminal returns with a
  frozen-clock bypass; political repair there suppresses fresh retaliation and
  notifications. Completion re-arms the process-local persistence deadline after
  final status/backlink mutation even when the restored receipt already records
  that persistence was requested; it does not extend an existing due time.
- The source liberation policy removes enemy police/roadblocks and creates at
  most two resistance aggregate infantry where capacity exists, with no
  automatic vehicle. Enemy recapture uses capacity/priority-scaled infantry and
  major-site vehicles; existing exact new-owner garrison authority is retained.
  Native population, balance, and exact-patrol settlement remain runtime gates.

### Inspected Packaged Runtime Evidence From Earlier Builds

The entries below are observations from explicitly identified earlier packaged
runs. They do not execute or certify the last sealed Blueprint Phase 8
source/Workbench checkpoint above.

- The run recorded **663 cases: 367 PASS, 61 WARN, 218 FAIL, and 17 BLOCKED**.
  It is not a passing certification result.
- **201 failures were cascading contamination from a defense mission that leaked
  beyond its owning probe.** Fixing that isolation defect is required before the
  remaining case totals can be interpreted as independent feature failures.
- The inspected Full Campaign Debug revision was destructive to the loaded campaign. The run
  forced a terminal loss, reduced faction money and HR to zero, created many
  durable rows, and autosaved the mutated state. Do not run the full profile
  against a valuable campaign. The post-audit guard described below has not yet
  been runtime-proven.
- Client evidence contains **6,806 static campaign-marker update VM exceptions**
  where the marker widget root is null. Marker state creation and native
  publication counters therefore do not prove a render-ready marker. The proof
  must inspect delayed widget-root readiness on the owning client.
- A newer short packaged check used the stamped schema-48 build
  `3157ca28b066630ffb87cac292f74e20ce243efd` and exposed a broader client
  initialization regression: the user had neither normal stock HUD nor usable
  Game Master. Config loading rejected the modded editor-manager, editable-budget,
  and placed-marker entry types before stock HUD initialization received a null
  editor manager. Source audit found that those config-backed modded class
  declarations had omitted the base class's container/custom-title metadata.
  Current source restores the matching attributes and passes the stamped source
  compile/startup gates,
  A later published schema-49 user check verified that normal UI, map markers,
  and Game Master access were available again, closing that specific metadata
  regression. The same check exposed separate marker-presentation and civilian
  ambience issues; those follow-up source changes are not runtime-certified yet.
- The latest packaged civilian evidence showed full civilian ambience at
  Simon's Wood, but none at Figari or Morton. The save already contained Figari
  and Morton as town-center zones with civilian ledgers. Their absence was
  caused by the HQ being within the 900-meter hostile safe radius: physical-war
  activation forced both zone-active flags false, and civilian ambience was
  incorrectly coupled to that military flag. Current source separates civilian
  player-distance eligibility and also separates the 900-meter hostile-operation
  staging clearance from location activation: only an HQ inside the location's
  capture footprint suppresses that location, while individual composition
  slots retain a 150-meter immediate HQ clearance. That allows Figari and
  Morton to physicalize normally without permitting a hostile group or prop to
  spawn on the HQ. The same source classifies Simon's Wood as a two-person farm
  locality, uses concrete appearance variants, gives true towns a configurable
  daytime/low-heat traffic target (default five) subject to population and global
  budgets, and clears ambient driver horn input. Campaign Debug Phase 20 now
  measures appearance
  uniqueness across the complete projected civilian actor set, including both
  pedestrians and traffic drivers, but a republished run is still required.
- The location review did not apply one flat garrison increase. Major military
  sites already carry substantially larger strategic garrison capacities (for
  example, airfield/seaport records versus town records), and physical-war caps
  add infantry and a second vehicle for airfields/seaports. That distinction is
  retained; runtime population and frame cost should be measured before raising
  the major-site caps further.
- The same packaged check showed eighteen radio markers paired with eighteen
  empty-imageset widget errors and giant colored marker boxes. The active
  config already contained the player entry, so the old ensure path returned
  before appending a radio icon; publication nevertheless used hard-coded index
  `91`. The attempted resource also named a quad absent from that imageset.
  Current source preserves/validates the canonical table, repairs or appends
  `radio-signal` from the stock wrapper normal/glow imagesets, resolves its real
  runtime index, rejects invalid placed icons, and labels zones as
  `Location | Owner: Faction`. Map-target prompts/dialogs now live below the
  native workspace pointer, so the pointer should remain visible over Confirm.
  Schema 59 now makes the radio lifecycle service the sole projection owner.
  Radio-zone composition and generic mission runtime never create, repair,
  complete, or delete an exact/quarantined transmitter. One unambiguous authored
  entity is borrowed and frozen without deletion ownership. Immutable authored
  prefab/position provenance remains separate from the current projection and
  is snapshotted into every admitted mission asset; ambiguity quarantines before
  mutation, and a missing handle never means destruction.
  DESTROYED authored damage is reapplied after streaming/restart. A replacement
  tower is generated only after a rebuild finishes, while the active
  stop-rebuild objective uses separate construction equipment instead of a
  second intact transmitter. That stop can be attempted once per tower-
  destruction epoch; destroyed equipment does not mint another epoch. Each
  mission physical projection also has an ID distinct from the stable site
  target. These fixes are source/Workbench evidence only and require the
  requested republished map/dialog/destroy/rebuild/restart check. Authored
  identity remains a 0.75-meter match, while bounded safe-ground projection and
  evidence allow 12 meters. Streamed-out borrowed targets use explicit dormant
  pending flags; broken reciprocal runtime rows quarantine.
- The final stamped schema-54 tree identifies implementation
  `09a1470a4c27dbef866e8cbdba182a7df65fa027` and has clean headless Game-module
  compile/create evidence at 5,760 files/11,560 classes with CRC `c62de929`. This is source/
  compile evidence rather than packaged gameplay proof. A normal schema-54
  WorldEditor open also remained alive for all ten samples over 20 seconds with
  no crash signature. During schema 50, the initial
  correctly quoted Workbench attempts exposed a native compiler edge in the
  already-large Campaign Debug Phase 20 civilian population method. Adding five
  appearance/horn count locals caused `0xc0000374` before `Module: Game` without
  a script diagnostic, while the production civilian and strategic services
  compiled in isolation. Splitting the post-selection probe and aggregating the
  new counts in `HST_CivilianProjectionProofSummary` removes that method-local
  pressure without dropping assertions. The correctly launched schema-50
  WorldEditor remained responsive for all ten samples over 20 seconds with no
  script-error, unknown-class, or crash signature. Schema 52 encountered the
  same zero-diagnostic native failure before `Module: Game` while its proof/save
  validation surface was still monolithic; extracting save validation and
  splitting corruption fixtures into focused methods restored the clean current
  gates without removing assertions. These are source/compile/startup gates,
  not packaged-runtime proof.
- Schema 51 adds the first exact enemy-order consumer in source. A newly planned
  infantry-only defensive QRF freezes one prepaid manifest from a distinct
  same-faction source, creates one reciprocal order/operation/batch/group
  aggregate, suppresses parallel legacy QRF/support authority, travels through
  held/physical/folded projection states, applies defensive pressure once,
  returns to origin, and settles the survivor fraction of attack/support costs
  once. Six `enemy_qrf.*` fixtures cover admission, legacy isolation,
  projection, settlement, current-schema restore, and rejection/refund. Their
  integration, settlement/archive replay, and successful Workbench compile are
  source evidence only; no packaged run has yet proved AI movement, physical arrival, casualties,
  marker rendering, resource accounting, or process restart for this slice.
- Schema 52 adds the first exact mission-convoy operation in source. Every newly
  started convoy freezes one persisted generated road route, exactly three
  vehicle slots, three reciprocal crew groups and their durable member slots,
  and mission-kind-compatible cargo/captive authority assigned to vehicle zero.
  Money/supplies require one cargo row, prisoners require one captive row, and
  ammo/armored/reinforcement convoys forbid a separate row; admission rejects a
  duplicate, incompatible role/kind, or prefab without a loadable mission-asset
  entity source. Captives must be boardable characters with compartment access;
  ordinary payloads must be non-character entities. Restore reapplies the same
  contract before normalizing a current-schema aggregate.
  Its three convoy
  elements advance virtually, materialize near players, fold only when clear of
  contact/occupancy/interaction and pending spawn work, retain confirmed crew
  casualties, and settle after route-authoritative arrival or the existing
  once-only convoy outcome. If crew elimination leaves cargo/captive/vehicle
  recovery unresolved, the operation remains open in a reprojectable on-station
  recovery hold instead of settling early. Destroyed/captured vehicle survivors
  are retained as exact crew-only roots without recreating the vehicle; folding
  is atomic across separated roots, and frozen-carrier cargo remains a ground
  recovery at either terminal disposition. Exact slot/entity mappings retain
  non-suffix member deaths, partial crewless vehicles remain independently
  reprojectable/capturable, cargo-only recovery remains materializable, clean
  player-bound cargo can release unrelated convoy roots, and capture detaches
  frozen cargo before the authoritative vehicle-to-garage handoff. Outbound
  publication revalidates and publishes every vehicle, group, mapped member,
  and cargo participant atomically. Historical restored convoys remain contract version
  `0`. Foundation and headless Workbench compile/create validation are source
  evidence only; no packaged run has proved three physical vehicles/drivers,
  interception, fold/rematerialization, casualty persistence, arrival,
  settlement, marker cleanup, or process restart.
  Nine `mission_convoy.*` deterministic assertions cover admission and
  rollback, virtual/projection and fold gating, casualty-stable restore,
  idempotent settlement, open/settled/recovery restore, aggregate-marker cleanup,
  and the materialization watchdog. Admission/corruption subfixtures additionally
  reject invalid cargo, foreign authority, invalid seat topology, forged arrival
  receipts, illegal lifecycle pairs, and casualty authority on non-member roots,
  while preserving missionless exact-looking durable claimants. They remain
  in-process fixtures, not engine/runtime evidence.
- Before every real persistence capture, the schema-52-through-60 authority set
  synchronously reconciles mapped physical convoy members and every currently
  cut-over physical or dematerializing exact-infantry family so a death cannot be
  saved as alive before the normal physical-war tick. Patrols, mission guards,
  and exact player support require unique root/member adapter ownership and
  matching PhysicalWar cardinality. Exact player support additionally receives
  a global exhaustive mapped-casualty pass, then per-aggregate reciprocal-link
  and living-binding cardinality validation plus a refreshed live physical
  position before capture. An open outbound publication transaction,
  materializing exact-infantry handoff, missing/conflicting or aliased mapping,
  invalid cardinality, unverifiable live position, or nonphysical operation
  retaining member mappings defers the checkpoint before stale state is flushed
  or a savepoint is requested; intent remains pending for bounded retry. Restore
  accepts casualty tombstones only on member slots, validates legal lifecycle
  pairs, and retains malformed exact-looking rows as durable quarantine evidence.
- Schema 53 adds exact authority for newly queued enemy `PATROL` orders. One
  proactive attack debit funds one frozen infantry root and reciprocal route/
  order/operation/manifest/held-batch/group aggregate. Its persisted generated-
  route cursor owns outbound travel, exactly one closed on-station lap, and the
  return-to-origin leg. The same member slots own virtual and physical survivors;
  mapped casualties survive fold, reprojection, and restore. Physical contact
  holds progress until clear. Return settles one survivor-proportional proactive
  refund. Type-plus-version dispatch isolates exact patrol, exact defensive QRF,
  legacy, quarantine, unsupported, and type-corrupt linked rows. Historical patrols remain contract
  version `0`, while malformed current rows retain evidence under version `-53`
  without cross-owner fallback. Unexplained binding loss blocks normal movement,
  fold, settlement, terminal cleanup, and capture instead of guessing a casualty.
  Terminal/setup settlement reconciles the complete mapped roster first, and
  quarantine capture waits until adapter and PhysicalWar ownership are both empty.
  Ten deterministic `enemy_patrol.*` assertions cover admission, collision-safe
  replay/refund, route loop, queue/roster bookkeeping, contact transition,
  settlement, physical-shaped restore, corruption, dispatch/priority isolation,
  and marker lifecycle.
  They are source fixtures, not packaged gameplay or restart proof.
- Schema 54 adds exact authority only for newly issued policy-v2 purchased
  resistance garrisons. Admission freezes one executable `NotSpawned` empty
  group root plus the arbitrary ordered members priced by the quote, then links
  quote/manifest/garrison/operation/held-batch/local-route/active-group identity.
  The accepted roster does not increment the legacy aggregate infantry count;
  its living held slots reserve capacity and advance an infinite local patrol
  loop while virtual. Near-player materialization releases only survivors, and
  fold returns the same casualties/cursor to strategic hold. Adapter roster
  validation now compares current infantry with durable living slots after first
  handoff, closing the prior survivor-only rematerialization rejection.
  PhysicalWar excludes these exact groups from legacy garrison activation,
  composition, waypoint, population, survivor-fold, route, and cleanup paths.
  Owner change, all-dead, campaign stop, setup, or typed spawn/route failure
  records one
  `exact_garrison_patrol_terminal` receipt with zero refund or aggregate survivor
  transfer. Pre-schema-54 policy-v1 purchases and initial/enemy aggregate
  garrisons remain legacy with no invented operation/roster/route/settlement;
  malformed current graphs retain evidence under version `-54` without legacy
  conversion, refund, or guessed casualty. A roster-authoritative marker and
  Forces UI row expose virtual/live position, location/current owner, role, and
  survivors. Nine deterministic `garrison_patrol.*` assertions cover admission,
  replay/rollback, roster projection, route loop, projection hold, settlement,
  restore, corruption, and marker lifecycle. The stamped Schema-54 Workbench
  compile/open gates passed as recorded above. Packaged native waypoint
  movement, casualty observation, fold/rematerialization, save/restart, client
  marker rendering, replication, reconnect, and JIP proof remain open.
- Schema 55 adds exact authority only for guard infantry belonging to a newly
  started `assassinate_officer` mission. Admission freezes one catalog-backed
  `NotSpawned` empty execution root and ordered infantry members, with no route,
  vehicles, assets, resources, or HVT entry. The held roster is the only guard-
  strength authority across materialization, mapped casualties, fold, restore,
  and survivor-only re-entry. While virtual it remains on station at a
  deterministic offset from the separate HVT; there is no virtual guard combat.
  All guards dead settles the operation `DESTROYED` while the HVT mission can
  remain active. HVT success settles surviving guards `COMPLETED`; mission
  failure/expiry, campaign stop, or setup maps to `CANCELLED`; target-owner
  change maps to `INVALIDATED`; and coherent spawn/assignment failure maps to
  `SPAWN_FAILED`. Every terminal branch records
  `exact_mission_guard_terminal` once with zero refund or legacy-force transfer.
  Historical officer missions, `assassinate_traitor`, `assassinate_specops`, and
  all other mission families remain contract `0`; pre-55 migration invents no
  operation, roster, casualty, or settlement authority for them. Compact settled
  graphs may omit their batch, group, and terminal HVT runtime row. Malformed
  current graphs use `-55` quarantine without fallback, guessed casualty, HVT
  backlink, or refund; the diagnostic quarantine does not fail the otherwise
  playable HVT mission. Existing HVT marker/UI rows append authoritative guard
  status and no duplicate operation marker is published. Focused
  `mission_guard.*` source fixtures cover admission/isolation, survivor/HVT
  separation, typed settlement, restore/migration, corruption quarantine, and
  marker status. The stamped Schema-55 tree identifies implementation
  `552c2c4ff5ac7608fa248c614480a254769b61a4`, passes the full foundation gate,
  clean Workbench Game validation at 5,763 files/11,570 classes with CRC
  `0ec8950e`, and a ten-sample/20-second normal WorldEditor open. Native entities,
  real adapter bindings/casualties, actual save/restart, rendered marker/UI,
  owner-change, campaign-setup, packaged networking, reconnect, and JIP remain
  open proof gates.
- Campaign persistence Schema 56 is stamped. It opts in only guard infantry
  belonging to a newly started `assassinate_traitor`
  mission, using contract version `2`, manifest policy
  `exact_assassinate_traitor_guard_v1`, and malformed-current quarantine version
  `-56`. Schema-55 officer guards remain exact under contract `1`/quarantine
  `-55`; historical or pre-56 traitor missions, `assassinate_specops`, and all
  other mission families remain contract `0` and gain no invented authority.
  The traitor slice uses the same route-less held roster and separate HVT
  identity: only durable guard members own strength across materialization,
  observed casualties, fold, compact restore, and survivor-only re-entry, while
  the HVT remains solely the mission objective/runtime asset. Typed terminal
  settlement records zero refund and no legacy-force transfer; eliminating all
  guards may settle their operation while leaving the HVT mission active. The
  existing HVT marker/UI appends roster-authoritative guard status rather than
  publishing a duplicate operation marker. Pre-56 restore records
  `migration_schema56_exact_traitor_guard` without manufacturing a graph, while
  malformed current authority records
  `normalization_schema56_exact_traitor_guard_conflict` and remains quarantined
  without legacy fallback. Six focused source-proof categories cover admission/
  isolation, projection lifecycle, settlement, restore/migration, corruption
  quarantine, and marker status. The stamped tree identifies implementation
  `bab5748d817ba434dae701cfbb3b92805d463678`, build label
  `schema56-exact-traitor-guard`, and passes the full foundation gate. Workbench
  Game validation loaded 5,764 files/11,573 classes with CRC `a18c67a5` and
  `Script validation successful`. Its bounded hidden normal WorldEditor open
  stayed alive for all ten samples over 20 seconds; the latest log had no script-
  error/crash signature. These source/Workbench gates are not packaged runtime
  proof. Native entities, adapter casualty observation, real save/restart,
  rendered UI, owner change, campaign setup, packaged networking, reconnect, and
  JIP remain unclaimed. The next planned narrow cutover is newly started
  `assassinate_specops` guards only; that statement is retained here solely as
  the stamped Schema-56 historical boundary.
- The historical campaign-persistence Schema 57 checkpoint is stamped. It opts in only
  guards belonging to a newly started `assassinate_specops` mission at contract
  `3`, policy `exact_assassinate_specops_guard_v1`, intent
  `assassinate_specops_guard`, and malformed-current quarantine version `-57`.
  Officer `1`/`-55` and traitor `2`/`-56` remain exact. Historical/pre-57
  spec-ops missions, ordinary `mission_group_*` rows, rescue missions, and every
  unsupported family remain contract `0`. Although generic spec-ops composition
  may propose multiple groups, contract `3` deterministically selects the
  strongest executable group, keeps the stable first group on ties, and freezes
  only that selected catalog roster; discarded groups gain no authority. The
  contract-3 path reuses the same
  route-less held roster, separate HVT identity, survivor-only materialization/
  fold/re-entry, no virtual guard combat, typed zero-refund terminal mapping,
  compact restore, and existing-HVT status. Pre-57 restore records
  `migration_schema57_exact_specops_guard`; malformed current authority records
  `normalization_schema57_exact_specops_guard_conflict` and remains diagnostic
  without fallback, guessed casualty, HVT backlink/failure, refund, or force
  transfer. Six `specops_guard.*` source-proof categories cover the boundary.
  The stamped implementation is `514ebdcbeb1ddfb2a383b19590382517113e2ff6`
  with build label `schema57-exact-specops-guard`. The full foundation gate
  passes, including Schema-55/56/57. Stamped Workbench Game validation loaded
  5,765 files/11,576 classes with CRC `e0b8578e` and
  `Script validation successful`; the bounded hidden normal WorldEditor open
  stayed alive for 10/10 samples over 20 seconds, and its log had no script-
  error/crash signature. Native entities/adapter casualties, real save/restart,
  rendered UI, owner change, campaign setup, packaged networking, reconnect,
  and JIP remain open. The assassination-guard family is exhausted.
- Campaign persistence Schema 58 is an earlier stamped separate rescue cutover
  only for newly started `rescue_pows`. Contract `1`, policy
  `exact_rescue_pows_v1`, intent `rescue_pows_guard`, and quarantine `-58` bind
  one guard roster plus three typed POW slots. The queue executes only the
  guard root/member subgraph; external captive authority stores stable escort,
  carrier, seat, request, casualty, extraction, and projection evidence.
  HELD/FREED may fold outside the bubble, custody stays projected, and missing
  entities do not imply death. Guard elimination does not settle rescue; one
  casualty receipt fails, three HQ extraction receipts succeed, and the
  300-second expiry grace opens only with all living POWs already in custody
  and accepts no new claims. Pre-58 POWs and `rescue_refugees` remain contract
  `0`. Restore records `migration_schema58_exact_rescue_pows`; conflicts record
  `normalization_schema58_exact_rescue_pows_conflict` and remain diagnostic
  without invented death, extraction, reward, fallback, or force transfer.
  Six source-proof categories cover admission isolation, composite authority,
  captive transitions, guard independence, outcome/grace, and restore/
  quarantine. Schema 58 is an earlier stamped source/Workbench baseline at
  implementation `f0ba07ff2bc295d12542a3ea34b4c913e99b1869` with build label
  `schema58-exact-rescue-pows`. The full foundation gate passes. Final stamped-
  tree Workbench Game validation loaded 5,770 files/11,594 classes with CRC
  `aa73883a` and `Script validation successful`; the bounded hidden normal
  WorldEditor open stayed responsive for 10/10 samples over 20 seconds with zero
  crash/error matches. Native entities, natural guard combat and vehicle seats,
  actual save/restart, rendered UI, owner change, setup, packaged networking,
  reconnect, and JIP remain open until a fresh published runtime artifact.
- Campaign persistence Schema 59 is the preceding stamped implementation cutover for
  radio sites. Every radio zone has one deterministic durable site/target row
  with ONLINE/DESTROYED/REBUILDING/QUARANTINED state, frozen binding,
  BORROWED_WORLD or GENERATED_CAMPAIGN ownership, one active mission lock,
  typed admission/outcome fingerprint, revision, timestamps, and destruction/
  rebuild receipts. Only newly started `destroy_radio_tower` and
  `dynamic_stop_tower_rebuild` opt into contract `1`; historical terminal rows
  remain contract `0` and active legacy rows fail closed. The stable site target
  ID is not reused as a physical handle: every exact mission gets a unique
  runtime-entity ID. Borrowed destruction requires the reciprocal active
  mission/site lock and revision plus authoritative tracked damage state;
  generated explosive scoring additionally requires a live matching mission
  component, bounded position, mission-time ownership provenance, and a unique
  key in the persisted bounded evidence set. Checked physical destroy/heal/
  rollback writes prevent a refused world mutation from becoming a durable
  outcome. Stop-rebuild can be attempted only once per tower-destruction epoch;
  destroying its equipment
  records that attempt and leaves the original tower-destruction epoch intact.
  The supported authored target is a retained multiphase-damage object. A new-
  campaign reset restores that authored target before state replacement or
  fails closed, while permanent generated ONLINE projections keep verbose
  witness logging disabled and leave nearby-entity witness queries dormant
  until an exact asset/mission/role identity is configured. Restore records
  `migration_schema59_radio_site_authority`; malformed current identity,
  binding, receipt, timestamp, transition, or backlink claims record
  `normalization_schema59_radio_site_authority_conflict` and quarantine at
  `-59`. Generated ONLINE restore additionally requires destruction followed by
  completed-rebuild provenance. Current corrupt linked aggregates are failed and
  cleaned together, while coherent historical terminal outcomes keep their
  terminal meaning. Only resolved ONLINE sites emit town radio influence, and
  marker/UI labels consume the same lifecycle. Generic runtime/composition/objective/
  commander-progress paths are fenced out. Focused source proof calls production
  transition and durable-evidence code, rejects direct repeat rebuild admission,
  and proves linked quarantine cleanup through projection-only seams. It and
  Workbench compilation do not certify native candidate discovery, explosives, damage-state
  reapplication, generated replacement visuals, streaming, process restart,
  rendered UI, owner change, setup, packaged networking, reconnect, or JIP.
  The stamped Schema-59 source/Workbench checkpoint identifies implementation
  `37fb5f0ffbc80c4bba3151ba1e5d8be6ffcf8a21` with build label
  `schema59-radio-site-lifecycle`. The full Foundation gate passes; Workbench
  loaded 5,773 files/11,608 classes with CRC `96914c26` and reported
  `Script validation successful`. The bounded normal WorldEditor open stayed
  alive/responding for 10/10 samples over 20 seconds with no script-compile or
  crash signature; one Steamworks stats-request error was nonfatal.
- Campaign persistence Schema 60 is the preceding stamped source/Workbench
  checkpoint: implementation `fdf78493dd15915afe8d53f61a8ad1efd65b5635`, UTC
  `2026-07-11T23:24:55Z`, and label `schema60-exact-search-destroy`. Full
  Foundation passes with 644 symbol references. Final Workbench Game validation
  loaded 5,777 files/11,615 classes with CRC `7aa80fc9` and created the game; the
  correctly targeted hidden normal WorldEditor stayed alive/responding for 10/10
  samples over 20 seconds without a first-party error/crash signature. Diff check
  was clean apart from line-ending warnings. Only newly quoted/confirmed player Search-and-Destroy uses
  contract `1` and the separate operation type. The immutable infantry-only
  manifest costs $350 plus one HR per frozen member, and remains linked to its
  paired ledger, request, operation, held batch, and active group across direct
  virtual travel, proximity materialization, casualty-preserving fold/re-entry,
  bounded abstract-garrison combat, displaced-fold return to assignment, and
  commander recall. Hostile clearance leaves the operation on station. Pre-60
  Search-and-Destroy remains contract `0`; malformed current claimants retain
  evidence under `-60` without legacy fallback or guessed balances. Campaign-
  state group classification excludes quarantine mode/status from both
  operational and combat-present views. Expired exact-support capacity can evict
  a tombstone and paired terminal request only after replay validity, unique
  aggregate identity, absence of live backlinks, and complete terminal-receipt
  reciprocity. That full receipt rule applies to every positive typed player-
  support contract, including exact QRF; historical contract-0 QRF keeps its
  minimal compatibility match. Malformed/quarantined typed pairs remain evidence. The focused proof
  service now includes valid pair prune/restore and corrupt quarantine retention.
  It is compiled and wired into Campaign Debug, but its Schema-60 assertions have
  not run. Its in-memory seams are not packaged movement/combat, actual save/
  restart, rendered UI, networking, reconnect, or JIP evidence.
  No packaged server/client, actual save/restart, rendered UI, stutter/horn,
  networking, reconnect, JIP, or live-behavior proof exists.
- Campaign persistence Schema 61 is the sealed marker-only authoritative
  client-projection boundary beneath Schema 62. Marker records carry per-ID revisions,
  last global stream sequences, and tombstones under a persisted epoch and
  monotonic watermark. The server owns a bounded current registry/journal and
  ownership-derived player readiness/ACK sessions; it emits hashed chunked
  snapshots or retained contiguous deltas, and falls back to snapshot for first
  join, reconnect, late join, gap, mismatch, or explicit resync. The client
  stages snapshots atomically, applies only contiguous record revisions, and
  keeps its registry independent of map-widget readiness before reconciling
  client-local native campaign markers. Server-native campaign marker
  publication is retired; dynamic player markers remain on the existing path.
  One in-flight batch, final-only ACK, post-ACK catch-up, five-second readiness
  heartbeat, and per-dispatch restart age cover rapid mutation, incomplete
  delivery, and lost ACK. Builders fail closed under the same bounds as the
  decoder. Static authored zone markers bind by exact cached entity name with
  unresolved-only retry rather than a periodic radius query. A stock descriptor
  hides only after its deterministic-priority custom replacement is live and
  restores prior visibility on failure. Migration rebuilds pre-61 derived rows without
  inventing domain facts; malformed current projection advances the epoch before
  rebuild. The compiled deterministic proof defines initial/late-join snapshot
  equality, stable rebuilds, ordered create/update/delete, snapshot-pending and
  rapid mutation, final-only multi-packet ACK, lost-ACK recovery, dropped-delta
  resync, epoch reset, reconnect, ACK pruning, malformed/oversize input, and migration
  idempotency fixtures, but they have not run in Campaign Debug. This is source/
  Workbench structure only. No packaged host/two-
  client equality, actual reconnect/late join, rendered native-marker cleanup,
  map-close continuity, serialization/restart, or mixed-version behavior has
  been observed. The sealed Schema-61 marker stamp identifies
  implementation `27672e67ce4285810f313130293df1ac917c9bdf`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T01:02:39Z`, and label
  `schema61-authoritative-marker-projection`. Full Foundation passes with 655
  symbol references; final Workbench Game validation loaded 5,782 files/11,631
  classes with CRC `df41a779` and created the game; hidden normal WorldEditor
  stayed responsive 10/10 over 20 seconds without a first-party error/crash
  signature.
- Campaign persistence Schema 62 is an earlier sealed canonical ownership source/
  Workbench boundary at implementation
  `7c93e0a485bcabe5a364c0b0cfeca235accb50f7`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T06:11:19Z`, and label
  `schema62-canonical-ownership-transition`.
  The full Foundation gate passes with 670 script-symbol references. The focused
  ownership proof is source-wired with durable queued intent, staged full-marker
  rollback, resolver fail-close/purge, setup history through activation, support
  set/prefix and derived correlations, persistence deadline/re-arm, shared logical
  snapshot construction, two-child atomic release, and two restart boundaries
  for exactly-once political completion, but has not run in Campaign Debug.
  Final stamped-tree headless Workbench Game validation loaded 5,785 files/
  11,652 classes with CRC `22c13a32` and zero script errors.
  The normal Script Editor open loaded the same tree, remained responsive, and
  did not crash. Zero Workbench processes survived the tests. No
  packaged result should be attributed to Schema 62 until that separate gate
  runs.
- The compiled/wired operation-record archive proof now includes typed exact-QRF
  receipt-mismatch retention under forced capacity. It has not been executed by
  Campaign Debug and is not a final Schema-60 gate result.
- Exact-support fold, physical recall exit, and campaign-stop retirement now
  exhaustively reconcile the affected projection before reading survivors or
  retiring its runtime root. A surviving projection must prove one root plus
  exactly one unique adapter and PhysicalWar member binding per durable living
  slot. Held-batch cancellation snapshots the strategic living roster before
  cleanup, so an immediate recall uses post-casualty strength. The focused
  Schema-60 casualty/fold/immediate-recall assertion is explicitly a synthetic
  queue-source fixture: it confirms one queue-slot casualty, folds the held
  roster, and checks settlement bookkeeping. It does not observe a native death
  through the live adapter, retire a real projection root, or traverse the
  physical recall-exit route. Those remain packaged-runtime gates, as does real
  persistence capture after adapter reconciliation/cardinality validation and
  live-position refresh.
- The latest user server feedback added three runtime baselines: a pronounced
  once-per-second stutter, AI vehicles holding their horns continuously, and two
  nearly overlapping Maiden's Bay locations. Source audit found repeated whole-
  group reconciliation, pure-vehicle count oscillation, recurring authority
  refresh, repeated unresolved-radio queries, and eager visual-evidence scans on
  the one-second tick. Schema-60 source keeps vehicle-only groups on vehicle
  count, skips redundant/no-convoy survivor scans, reuses registered recurring
  player authority, round-robins unresolved radio discovery, and defers costly
  evidence until its log throttle emits. The native wheeled-vehicle base now
  disables AI horn timing/output, with ambient driver input reset retained. The
  location registry/save cleanup keeps only the Logistics Warehouse. It leaves
  no-anchor saves untouched, fails closed before rewrites under ambiguous
  location authority, canonicalizes mutable generic references, and preserves
  all nonzero typed authority—including settled/quarantined/malformed and
  graphless exact rows—under the frozen ID. Frozen generated sites/routes receive
  deep canonical clones rather than identity rewrites; mutable lookup resolves
  the warehouse, while exact historical lookup and runtime equivalence preserve
  old assignments. The isolated migration proof is compiled and wired into
  Campaign Debug but its assertion has not run. A fresh published server run
  must measure freeze cadence, listen to AI traffic, and test fresh plus pre-
  update saves/restart before any of these are marked fixed.
- Not every hard failure is a cascade. Convoy movement/seating, support routing,
  and physical response behavior retain genuine runtime failures that need
  scoped reproduction after debug isolation is fixed.
- Several red rows in the inspected artifact are known harness false negatives:
  support clearance expects
  `true` while the runtime reports boolean `1`; search-marker evidence is checked
  after teardown instead of at the captured observation point; the economy delta
  compares a pre-tick expectation with a post-tick report; the generated-site
  assertion expects 13 where the registry intentionally contains 12; the case
  headline can preserve an earlier WARN while hiding a later FAIL; and support
  movement/formation evidence can be sampled after the group has already folded.
  Current source repairs all six, but the historical artifact remains unchanged
  until a fresh isolated run executes the corrected harness.
- The inspected gameplay artifact predates campaign schema 43 exact-force
  authority, schema 44 SpawnQueue authority, the schema 45 engine adapter, and
  the schema 46 exact player-QRF cutover, schema 47 exact force-runtime
  lifecycle authority, schema 48 accepted-settlement archive, schema 49
  exact-QRF operation authority, schema 50 strategic projection, schema 51
  exact enemy defensive-QRF authority, schema 52 exact mission-convoy authority,
  schema 53 exact enemy-patrol authority, schema 54 exact purchased-garrison
  patrol authority, schema 55 exact officer-mission guard authority, and schema
  56 exact traitor-mission guard authority.
  The schema-45 authority baseline passed foundation checks and a headless
  Workbench Game compile. Its isolated state case covers quantities 1/4/7/12,
  an HR reservation-conflict rollback, and five partial confirmation save/
  restore boundaries. The deterministic `early_mechanics.spawn_queue` case
  covers admission, identity, scheduling, retry, dependency cleanup, retention,
  migration, and restore state. Schema 45 additionally implements a production
  one-second active-phase tick and an exact single-infantry-group/member adapter.
  None of these later cases has been executed by the inspected run. Any physical
  adapter proof present in current code remains harness coverage rather than
  engine-backed evidence until a fresh isolated runtime executes it.

Post-audit safety follow-up: the in-process runner now fails closed outside
`HST_Dev`, blocks external/soak profiles, persists the live baseline, runs
against a deep-cloned campaign state, diverts checkpoint calls to isolated
memory, and swaps the untouched live state back on completion or cancellation.
Foundation checks and Workbench script validation pass for this boundary. It has
not yet been runtime-proven, and a development-session restart remains required
because world entities, player inventory/health, delayed callbacks, and service
caches are not campaign-save fields.

Post-audit false-negative follow-up: support clearance now uses the shared bool
parser that accepts both `true` and `1`; the incoming search marker retains its
icon in the immediate post-request snapshot; expected income and the economy
report are both sampled before the forced tick; the curated resource minimum is
12; case status and reason are selected by explicit severity; and support target,
member-count, editable-size, RUN-movement, and formation evidence are captured
before terminal fold. Foundation validation passes. The Game module compiled
5,739 files/11,472 classes and created the game, and a separate normal
WorldEditor project open remained responsive at every two-second sample through
20 seconds with no script-error or crash signature. This proves compilation and
startup survival, not corrected Full Campaign Debug runtime results.

Post-audit marker follow-up: the client-side static-marker manager now retries
widget construction before update and disables a marker that remains rootless,
preventing the stock update call from dereferencing a missing root. The delayed
owner-client proof now reports active roots, widget components, visible roots,
disabled-rootless counts, and bounded missing-marker identity samples. Static
and Workbench validation pass; the prior 6,806 exceptions remain the latest
runtime evidence until a fresh map-open run proves the guard and census.

Post-audit compiler follow-up: the native Workbench heap crash was isolated to
one oversized force-authority proof, which was extracted into bounded service
methods. The latest schema-47 Game-module run loaded 5,737 files/11,462 classes,
created the game, and completed script validation successfully. A separately
launched normal WorldEditor project open created the game and remained
responsive at every two-second check through 20 seconds before the verified test
PID was stopped; the crash did not reproduce. The physical HST_Dev and paid-QRF
proofs still require fresh runtime execution before this audit can treat either
as engine-proven.

Post-audit current-build server smoke follow-up: a short normal-campaign run
loaded the stamped schema-48 build, completed setup/player authority, opened the
command menu, rejected Full Campaign Debug outside `HST_Dev`, populated active
zones, and folded them back after the player intentionally disconnected. The
server remained live after the engine wrote `crash.log`; the later disconnect
and shutdown were intentional and must not be mislabeled as the crash. The log
still contains a genuine recoverable VM exception during late admin-role
assignment: the player-role invoker entered editor mode repair, `AddMode()`
called `UpdateLimited()`, and the synchronous Game Master role grant attempted
to invoke the same role-change dispatcher recursively. The current tree defers
only `SCR_EditorManagerCore.OnPlayerRoleChange()` onto the next frame while
leaving stock mode updates, teardown, and role ownership intact. Foundation validation passes, the Game
module compiles and creates at 5,740 files/11,476 classes, and a normal
WorldEditor open produced no new crash signature during the bounded survival
gate. A fresh dedicated-server connect/admin-role run is still required before
the recursive-invoker defect is closed by runtime evidence.

Post-audit civilian-group projection follow-up: that same current-build smoke
recorded exactly 20 `RPC_DoOnGroupMemberStateChange` sends through unregistered
`SCR_AIGroup` items, matching its 14 ambient pedestrian groups plus 6 hidden
traffic-driver groups one-for-one. `HST_CivilianService` created every helper
from a bare group resource and immediately used the player-group membership
notification path. The resource therefore lacked the stock behavior tree,
formation, pathfinding, movement, vehicle utility, editable, and replication
components while helper cardinality could still make Phase 20 look behavior-
ready. Current source makes the dedicated CIV root inherit the stock generic
group base and attaches initial ambient AI through `AddAIEntityToGroup()` with
a direct `AddAgent()` fallback, matching the engine's initial composition path
without broadcasting the player-group member-state RPC. Civilian traffic also
registers its vehicle first and now prefers forced authority-local driver entry,
using the owner-RPC dispatch only as a fallback. Failed registration, seating,
or route setup deletes the traffic projection and its owned helpers so an inert
vehicle cannot consume the town target and suppress replacement. Foundation validation passes.
The Game module compiles 5,740 files/11,476 classes with CRC
`6e01a045` and creates the game, and a separate normal WorldEditor open remained
responsive at every two-second sample through 20 seconds with no script-error
or new crash signature. A fresh packaged run must still prove zero
unregistered-group RPCs and real distance-over-time pedestrian and traffic
movement before this defect is closed by runtime evidence.

Post-audit convoy seating follow-up: the non-cascade portion of the July 9
`logs_2026-07-09_14-09-10` artifact contains a three-vehicle ammo convoy whose
three native crew groups all populated 2/2 living agents, then remained in
`convoy_seating_pending` for the full grace window. Production changed the
mission to static contact because none of the three vehicles had a seated
living driver; `convoy.crew.driver_seated` was the first hard assertion and the
later waypoint failure was downstream. The adapter was unchanged after that
artifact. Its vehicle-usage registration occurred only in route assignment,
behind the seated-driver gate, and its first seating call treated a successful
`MoveInVehicle()` owner-RPC dispatch as if the move itself had completed.
Current source registers and verifies the pilotable vehicle with the crew-group
utility before issuing any seat request, attempts forced `GetInVehicle()` first
for locally authoritative convoy AI, retains `MoveInVehicle()` only as the
fallback after direct rejection or for a non-local entity, and makes the physical probe query retained vehicle
registration directly. Foundation validation passes. A fresh Game-module run
compiled 5,740 files/11,476 classes with CRC `6e01a045`
and created the game; a separate normal WorldEditor open stayed responsive at
every two-second sample through 20 seconds with no script-error or new crash
signature. A fresh scoped convoy runtime must still prove 3/3 living pilot
occupants, waypoint chains, movement, no static fallback, and exact cleanup.

Post-audit support route-truth follow-up: the July 9
`logs_2026-07-09_14-09-10` normal-play artifact contains affected rows
`support_FIA_729_0`, `support_FIA_808_1`, and `support_FIA_835_3`. Reversing the
deterministic 2,100m recall-exit projection from each logged target and exit
vector implies nominal current positions approximately 434m, 455m, and 505m
away despite `physical_arrived`. A fourth arrival row implied approximately 30m,
so this is evidence of three false completions rather than a claim that every
arrival was false.
The prior path allowed ETA and elapsed-time route interpolation to overwrite
physical truth. The same evidence includes a Phase 22 attacker group populated
9/9 that did not show advance, but its sampling used campaign time rather than
repeated live member positions; it is therefore a reproduction lead, not valid
physical-stall proof. Current source keeps a spawned support group's persisted
position on the living-member centroid, treats ETA as the earliest arrival check
only, and requires two live samples from distinct elapsed seconds within 75m
before either
arrival or a spawned recall exit can complete. Exact-QRF handoff normalizes to
`support_active`, and support routing builds a direct chain from the current
live position to the target or exit. Stalled chains have a maximum of three
consecutive reissues until an observed 8m new-best distance improvement resets
the budget.
Waypoint replacement is transactional and service-owned: a complete
replacement is prepared first, a failed preparation leaves the existing chain
intact, and a successful replacement removes the old waypoints from the group
before deleting them. This is a source repair, not runtime success. A fresh
packaged run must still prove actual movement, two-sample arrival, recall exit,
bounded reissue behavior, and cleanup.
Foundation validation passes. The stamped Game module compiles and creates at
5,740 files/11,476 classes with CRC `6e01a045`. A separate normal WorldEditor
project open remained responsive at every two-second sample through 20 seconds
with no script-error or new crash signature. This proves compilation and startup
survival, not physical support movement or arrival/recall runtime success.

Post-audit typed support-recall follow-up: recall mutation now returns an
explicit accepted/already-applied/state-changed/terminal disposition with
request and operation identity. Visible `support_recall` maps that result to an
explicit durable command receipt; report text is presentation only, so an
accepted terminal outcome can describe a failed deployment without being
recorded as rejected. Exact paired full refunds prevalidate both money and HR
identity, refund-state coherence, settleability, and deterministic settlement
replay before either transaction changes. Lost-group settlement checks its
result rather than reporting success after a rejected refund. Bounded cases
`authority.command.explicit_status`,
`force_authority.paid_qrf_recall_typed_text`,
`force_authority.paid_qrf_recall_settlement_failure`, and
`force_authority.paid_qrf_recall_lost_group` cover presentation-independent
receipt status/replay, identity and eligibility rejection, and valid/conflicting
lost-group settlement. Foundation validation and headless Workbench Game
compile/create pass at 5,740 files/11,477 classes with CRC `34f7b92b`. A separate
normal WorldEditor project open created the game and remained responsive at all
ten two-second samples before the exact test process was stopped, with no new
script-error or crash signature. These are in-process authority and bounded
startup proofs, not production RPC, ledger/save restart, or physical recall-exit
runtime evidence.

Post-audit crewless mixed-QRF follow-up: the independent normal-play portion of
the July 9 `logs_2026-07-09_14-09-10` artifact materialized mixed response group
`qrf_depot_figari_supply_depot_US_1009_13` with two observed living infantry and
one linked vehicle. After both infantry died, native membership was zero and
reconciliation repeatedly reported infantry `0/5`, total live `1`, and status
`arrived`; the intact empty vehicle supplied that final aggregate count. The
group continued reconciling after its target changed ownership because capture
cleanup intentionally preserves QRFs. This is a genuine normal-play defect,
not part of the Full Campaign Debug defense cascade.

Current source separates living infantry from vehicle health for mixed-group
combat authority while retaining existing vehicle-only semantics. After prior
population evidence and the native/live-count grace windows, zero living
personnel applies one terminal transition, zeros strategic strength, resolves
an incomplete linked QRF as failed, removes capture and marker pressure, clears
combat handles, and preserves an intact attached vehicle as neutral disposable
session salvage. The vehicle record now uses the selected vehicle prefab rather
than the infantry-group prefab. Eliminated/spawn-failed save normalization
retains zero counts and clears process-local runtime identity instead of
backfilling original force totals, while folded rows retain their credited
survivor provenance. Session-only detached salvage records and their virtual
cargo are excluded from save capture and pruned on migration. The
vehicle disposition preserves any existing durable field/loot/garage record and
its virtual cargo instead of downgrading it to session-only state. The
`active_group_lifecycle.*` deterministic cases cover eligibility guards,
terminal replay, capture pressure, unresolved marker ordering, current-schema
roundtrip, folded-survivor preservation, session-record pruning, durable-record
preservation, living-mixed control, and vehicle-only control. The final build
stamped implementation SHA `3157ca28b066630ffb87cac292f74e20ce243efd`.
Foundation validation and headless Workbench Game compile/create pass at 5,741
files/11,481 classes with CRC `077afac2` in
`logs_2026-07-10_14-47-34`. A correctly quoted normal WorldEditor open created
the game with the same CRC, remained responsive at all ten two-second samples,
and stopped only exact test PID 41400 after 20 seconds;
`logs_2026-07-10_14-49-06` contains no new project script-error or crash
signature. This is source, deterministic in-process, compilation, and bounded startup
evidence—not physical entity detachment, player salvage, dedicated replication,
ownership-flip cleanup, or process-restart runtime proof.

The campaign-debug isolation comparator excludes the same session-only detached
vehicle class from its runtime-vehicle count. Its expected state comes from the
persisted deep clone, while the untouched live campaign can still own the
physical salvage entity; comparing raw counts would create an isolation false
failure without proving a mutation.

Post-audit Game Master/stock-HUD config follow-up: the latest packaged check was
not blocked by player authorization. Server evidence recognized the user as the
expected admin/member/commander, while client config loading reported unknown
`SCR_EditorManagerCore`, repeated unknown
`SCR_EditableEntityCoreBudgetSetting`, and unknown
`SCR_MapMarkerEntryPlaced` types. Stock HUD initialization then cascaded from a
null editor manager. These are recoverable VM/config failures rather than proof
of an operating-system process crash. The affected modded declarations now repeat
the base config contracts: config-root container metadata for the editor manager,
the editable-budget custom enum title, and marker icon/placed-entry container
plus custom-title attributes. A validator guard covers all four declarations.
The stamped schema-49 source passes foundation validation and creates the Game
module at 5,743 files/11,497 classes with CRC `4efe34fc`. A fresh normal
WorldEditor project open remained responsive for all ten samples through the
bounded 20-second gate and logged no unknown config class or crash signature.
This proves only source/startup compatibility; a republished client/server run
must show zero unknown types, normal stock HUD, and usable Game Master before the
defect is closed.

Post-audit schema-49 operation-authority follow-up: current source adds the first
canonical `HST_OperationRecordState` only for confirmed exact paid player
infantry QRFs. Quote issue keeps the stable operation identity but creates no
record; successful confirmation registers exactly one contract-version-1 record
with immutable origin/assignment, mutable tactical target, typed duty,
engagement, materialization, position authority, settlement, terminal result,
policy IDs, timestamps, execution links, and revision. Queue admission, physical
handoff, arrival, restore reprojection, recall/exit, terminal ledger settlement,
and accepted-settlement archival now advance or preserve that authority.
Settlement replay is idempotent and conflicting terminal outcomes fail closed.
The engagement API enforces the legal clear/contact/engaged/disengaging cycle and
preserves resumable duty, but no live combat-contact path calls it yet.

Schema-48 migration is deliberately conservative: only a uniquely coherent
accepted nonterminal exact paid QRF with matching quote/manifest, unique
committed money/HR transactions, and unique optional batch/group links receives
a record. Economy, ledger, request, quote,
manifest, queue, and group status are unchanged. Pre-exact, terminal,
archived-only, ambiguous, legacy/enemy, and other-support rows remain contract
version `0`. Restored open physical operations normalize to strategic
materializing until survivor reprojection; terminal archive compaction keeps
contract version, settlement ID, revision, and typed terminal result while
removing the full operation row. This remains source/compile/startup evidence.
`HST_OperationRecordProofService.Run()` is integrated into the existing
`early_mechanics.force_authority` case through eight stable assertions:
`operation_record.issue_confirm`, `operation_record.materialization`,
`operation_record.engagement`, `operation_record.recall_settlement`,
`operation_record.restore_projection`, `operation_record.schema48_migration`,
`operation_record.archive`, and `operation_record.legacy_qrf_isolation`. They
compile but have not run in a packaged runtime.
Real restart/migration and archive replay are pending, and schema 49 does not claim strategic route
cursor/hysteresis, generalized virtualization, vehicle/assets/multi-root forces,
or complete Phase 4 behavior.

Post-audit schema-50 strategic-projection follow-up: the first exact paid
infantry-QRF consumer now moves continuously on a held direct-route projection,
materializes exact survivors inside the player bubble, folds them back outside
the hysteresis radius, and runs bounded deterministic infantry-only combat while
virtually on station. Route preparation is valid while the operation remains
`STAGING`; `LinkOutboundVirtual` is the delivered-service commit to `OUTBOUND`.
Terminal failure before that boundary fully refunds money and HR. Failure after
commit, including an `OUTBOUND` or `ON_STATION` materialization failure with no
physical handoff, retains money and refunds exactly
`m_iLastVirtualFriendlyCount` HR. The deterministic paid-QRF proof now checks
both sides and replay idempotency. Restore normalizes the linked request with the
operation and batch: it clears `m_bPhysicalized`, keeps on-station work abstract-
resolved as `exact_virtual_on_station`, and uses
`exact_restore_survivor_virtual` for other open duty. These are source-level
contracts until a republished run executes the proof and a real process restart.

Post-audit schema-45 force-spawn follow-up: typed force-spawn results are durable
per-projection queue batches rather than manifest-only observations. The queue
rejects manifests without an executable required group root, orders priority/
FIFO work within two-batch/eight-action budgets, verifies exact callback identity
and evidence, and handles retry, deadline, cancellation, asset -> member ->
vehicle -> group cleanup, restore reconciliation, and pin-aware terminal
retention. Active groups now persist explicit force/projection links, and new
slot success persists Game Master verification beside prefab, liveness, faction,
native-group, projection, and applicable seat evidence. The production
  coordinator runs normal adapter acquisition once per active-campaign second;
  its current scope is exactly one infantry group root plus every frozen member.
  Verified slots first produce durable nonterminal `READY_FOR_HANDOFF`.
  `HST_PhysicalWarService` must finalize that exact projection before
  `CompleteProjectionHandoff` records `SUCCEEDED`, and its legacy paths hold
  queue-owned groups to prevent duplicate population. Restoring ready work clears
  transient evidence and requeues exact realization rather than accepting an
  interrupted handoff. During setup or after a won/lost outcome, the coordinator
  cancels every nonterminal batch and drains cleanup using a monotonic runtime-only
  clock without advancing campaign elapsed time. Vehicle/asset/multi-root
  execution, other paid-support migrations, successful terminal runtime restore/
  reprojection, and a durable casualty/living-force/retirement ledger were still
  open at that schema-45 checkpoint and are superseded in part by the schema-47
  follow-up below.
  At that schema-45 checkpoint, purchase-only garrison manifests were
  nondeployable and accepted quote/manifest/ledger history remained unbounded.
  Schema 48 later bounded that history, and schema 54 now makes only newly issued
  policy-v2 purchased resistance garrisons executable exact patrols; historical
  policy-v1 provenance remains nondeployable. Terminal queue evidence is historical,
  while process-local entity and native-group IDs are cleared on restore. The
  physical HST_Dev proof is implemented but has not been runtime-executed; compile,
  script-validation, and project-open evidence do not substitute for that run.

Post-audit schema-46 paid-QRF follow-up: selecting `support_qrf` with a map
target now issues a server quote without debit. The quote freezes one authored
infantry group execution root plus every ordered member slot, a flat $250 money
cost, one HR per member, 120-second ETA, and 600-second cooldown. A separate
Forces action confirms only the quote ID; server revalidation reserves money and
HR, registers one linked support request, commits both transactions, and marks
the quote accepted last. At inbound staging the request creates one stable
queue-owned active-group projection and submits the accepted manifest without
calling the broad composition service or prefab-name manpower estimation. The
request becomes physical only after queue `SUCCEEDED`. Schema 50 refines the
original deployment settlement rule: failure while still `STAGING` fully
refunds, while committed virtual `OUTBOUND`/`ON_STATION` service retains money
and refunds only its recorded virtual survivors even when materialization never
hands off. Recall uses the linked HR settlement policy. The current typed recall layer supplies explicit
receipt status/operation identity, checks lost-group settlement results, and
prevalidates both legs before a full refund. Restore reconciliation rolls back interrupted
confirmations before the generic reservation sweep. Schema 47 supersedes the
temporary restored-success full-refund fallback with survivor-only
reprojection. The bounded
`force_authority.paid_qrf_*` cases cover issue/confirm, post-admission replay,
current-schema roundtrip, failure/cancel/pre-success-recall settlement, typed
receipt replay/conflict handling, lost-group settlement, and pre-schema-46 ledger
import, but none is runtime evidence until a fresh isolated run records it.

Post-audit schema-47 force-runtime follow-up: successful exact infantry handoff
now increments durable handoff/lifecycle counters and marks the linked active
group spawn-completed and ever-populated. The adapter samples each handed-off
member's authoritative life state before pruning deleted transient handles. A
confirmed death retires only that manifest slot, persists its casualty second
and revision, detaches the corpse from native and Game Master group ownership
without deleting it, and updates strategic living strength. Missing or deleted
entities are not inferred as casualties. At zero durable living members,
physical war removes the exact root and the support settlement removes the
active-group marker without refunding dead HR or the already-delivered money
cost. Restore clears process-local IDs and requeues one new root plus only
durable survivors; a technical failure after a previous handoff retains money
and refunds surviving HR only. Pre-schema-47 successful batches receive one
historical handoff and ever-alive/ever-populated evidence without invented
casualties. Bounded `force_runtime.*` cases cover casualty idempotency, current-
schema lifecycle roundtrip, survivor-only reprojection, last-death roster state,
and schema-46 migration. They do not prove live corpse detachment, native/GM
counts, root/marker cleanup timing, or real process restart until an isolated
runtime executes them.

Post-audit schema-48 settlement-archive follow-up: accepted garrison and terminal
paid-QRF authority now remains in full quote/manifest/ledger form for at least
600 campaign seconds and while any active-group, enemy-order, or force-spawn
backlink exists. An eligible aggregate compacts atomically into a persisted
tombstone carrying actor, command, operation, manifest hash, aggregate, costs,
refunds, final transaction statuses, and settlement IDs. Archived issue,
confirmation, and committed transaction replay is checked before any new
mutation or debit; conflicts and already-refunded reservation replay fail closed.
Tombstones retain an 86,400-second minimum window, cap at 256, and share a hard
320-row admission bound with full quotes. The coordinator now supplies live
retention pins to queue terminal compaction so a full 128-row terminal history
cannot deadlock future admission or permanently pin a settled manifest. Bounded
`force_archive.*` cases cover both consumer kinds, refund evidence, replay,
backlink refusal, capacity/expiry, deep-copy persistence, and schema-47 migration.
These cases are not runtime or restart evidence until a fresh isolated run
records them. The final schema-48 Game-module check loaded 5,739 files/11,472
classes and created the game; a separate normal WorldEditor project open stayed
responsive at every two-second sample through 20 seconds with no crash signature.

Certification is blocked until the debug-isolation boundary and marker guard are
runtime-proven, the cascading mission is contained, known assertion defects are
corrected, and the genuine physical failures are rerun through scoped disposable
profiles.

Latest support simulated-physicalization follow-up: legacy search/roadblock and debug-only QRF lifecycle paths create durable support request and linked active-group state even when the target is outside the player event bubble, but runtime group/vehicle spawning is deferred until the simulated group position enters the bubble. Off-bubble legacy support groups can advance through active-group route simulation without being marked spawn-failed, folded, or resolved, and resistance support markers can follow simulated group state before entities exist. Full Campaign Debug adds `support.simulated_physicalization`, proving an off-bubble search support keeps active campaign state and marker coverage with no runtime entity, then physicalizes after the simulated group is moved inside the player event bubble. This is not evidence for the schema-46 exact paid-QRF queue path. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-support-simulated-physicalization`.

Latest marker/QRF/civilian server-test follow-up: AI factions no longer emit town QRF/roadblock support from mere active-zone pressure; reactive QRF/support/roadblock/counterattack orders now require both recent threat evidence and positive faction aggression, then pass a deterministic chance roll before spending support. Captures, mission success, mission failure, and mission expiry now record short-lived support threat signals when they raise faction aggression, while low garrison strength can still trigger rebuild-garrison decisions. The Everon map restores the second Regina tower as `Western Heights Radio Tower`, adds the two airport-side radio towers, and removes fuel-station zones/markers from campaign coverage. Marker taxonomy now matches the requested user-facing set: towns `OBJECTIVE_MARKER2`, military installations `FORTIFICATION`, radio towers native `radio-signal`, roadblocks `JOIN3`, live resistance support groups `DOT`, gun-shop seller/delivery `MARK_QUESTION`/`MARK_EXCLAMATION`, destroy `DESTROY2`, rescue `HELP`, and Defend Petros temporarily changes the HQ marker to `DEFEND`. Mission marker hover text is trimmed to mission name plus remaining time, with convoy staging/destination markers showing staged seconds until departure and then expiry minutes. Active groups now run a wider member-handle repair pass and non-police zone garrisons can receive patrol-cycle waypoints so visible AI groups are less likely to remain Size 0 or stand idle. Civilian defaults use randomized CIV archetypes, and schema 21 removes the old loot alias keys so generated settings only expose `lootSkipUnlockedItems` / `vehicleLootSkipUnlockedItems`. Local foundation validation passes with these contracts.

Latest r123 marker/group/civilian fix follow-up: this older pass introduced marker icon deconflict assertions and first-pass runtime group/civilian repair; the current top entry supersedes its earlier icon choices and restores the Regina2 site as Western Heights Radio Tower. Runtime group reconciliation scans nearby matching non-player AI, registers living and dead member handles, reattaches living agents to their `SCR_AIGroup`, reparents editable members, and records Game Master editable size in Full Campaign Debug so visually populated groups no longer remain Size 0 forever. Terminal cleanup can delete the stale group root/icon while leaving dead bodies for loot. Civilian runtime spawning uses a dedicated CIV empty group root and a hardened attach fallback, instead of inheriting the FIA fallback group, while Phase 20 keeps auditing actual CIV faction mismatches. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r123-marker-group-civilian-fixes`.

Latest r122 training-quality follow-up: resistance training now produces a derived FIA quality bonus instead of only acting as a cap gate. Each training level above 1 adds 5 percent effective infantry strength, capped at +45 percent. Capture status keeps the raw FIA headcount visible but uses trained effective strength for `m_iFIACountNearby`, so four level-6 FIA count as five strength in abstract capture pressure while still displaying as four soldiers. Force composition summaries now expose effective manpower and resistance training quality, garrison-created active groups carry a training-quality composition summary, and the command menu shows compact training quality labels. Full Campaign Debug adds `recruitment.training_quality.contract.runtime`, proving low/high training quality scaling, capture-strength application, force-composition evidence, and recruitment-report visibility. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r122-training-quality`.

Latest r121 training war-cap follow-up: resistance training now resolves its ceiling from campaign war level instead of allowing early-game maxing. The cap is `war level + 2`, clamped to level 10, so war level 1 campaigns cap at training 3 while higher-war campaigns keep opening room to train. Training above the current cap is not downgraded, but further training blocks without spending money until war level catches up. Recruitment reports now show current training and cap as `training current/cap`. Full Campaign Debug adds `recruitment.training.war_level_cap.contract.runtime`, proving low-war capped training blocks without spend, higher-war training advances below its cap, and the report exposes both cap values. Phase 16 training smoke now accepts war-level cap blocks instead of only hardcoded max-level blocks. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r121-training-war-cap`.

Latest r120 population-income follow-up: town income now scales from civilian population health. The town service multiplies town money income by `populationRemaining / (populationRemaining + populationKilled)`, gates town HR income when the surviving share drops below half, and leaves non-town source categories unchanged. Income reports now expose the town population percentage in both source totals and town rows. Full Campaign Debug adds `economy.income.population_scaling.contract.runtime`, proving a healthy town pays full income/HR while a casualty-hit town pays reduced money, loses HR, and reports the population multiplier. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r120-population-income-scaling`.

Latest r119 economy source-report follow-up: member economy inspection now includes the town-service income report instead of only the high-level money/HR and enemy pool summary. The report exposes next money/HR plus source-category totals for towns, resources, factories, seaports, airfields, banks, and other owned zones before listing per-zone income rows, so players can see what captured locations are contributing. Full Campaign Debug extends `economy.income_tick.exact_delta` with `economy.income.report_breakdown`, proving the player-facing report includes source totals and the same next-income values used by the income tick math. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r119-economy-income-source-report`.

Latest r118 undercover security-scan follow-up: police and roadblock undercover enforcement now uses deterministic chance/roll checks instead of fixed score thresholds. The chance scales from security presence, town/player heat, campaign war level, enemy aggression, and blocking eligibility evidence such as military vehicles or visible weapons, while failure reasons expose chance, roll, war, aggression, presence, and heat. Full Campaign Debug adds `undercover_security_scan_scaling.contract.runtime` to prove high-risk war/aggression/security fixtures produce higher scan chance than low-risk fixtures, and Phase 21 roadblock/police assertions now require the factorized chance evidence in the failed scan reason. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r118-undercover-security-scan-scaling`.

Latest r117 marker/group/civilian cleanup follow-up: marker icon deconflict assertions were added for radio tower, radar site, and search-team support markers; later work restored the Regina2 site as Western Heights Radio Tower and superseded the old duplicate-removal note. Runtime group reconciliation added tracked member-handle fallback coverage for Game Master Size 0 reports, and terminal group cleanup detaches dead member bodies before deleting the group root so loot remains while stale group icons disappear. Civilian runtime spawning began forcing CIV faction on spawned members and existing/new civilian AI groups, and Phase 20 audits actual faction-component mismatches. Full Campaign Debug added `support.search_marker_icon`, `phase23.marker.radio_icon`, `phase23.marker.radar_icon`, and `phase20.civilian_population.civ_faction_mismatches` coverage. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r117-marker-group-civilian-cleanup`.

Latest r116 police-presence projection follow-up: enemy-owned active towns now project civilian town `policePresence` into a runtime-only town-police patrol even when no abstract garrison exists. These patrols use dedicated town-police prefabs, are tagged as security projections, receive patrol-cycle waypoints, count as active local security while present, and delete on zone deactivation without folding back into the abstract garrison. Full Campaign Debug adds `town_police_presence_projection.contract.runtime`, proving a temporary enemy town with police presence but no garrison spawns the projection, assigns its patrol route/cycle, deactivates it without garrison refund, and cleans up the fixture. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r116-police-presence-projections`.

Latest r115 town-police patrol follow-up: enemy town-police active groups now keep a scoped town patrol route during active-group creation, bypass the generic static-route cleanup, and receive cyclic patrol waypoints once their runtime AI group has live agents. The patrol builder uses the town patrol route when available and falls back to a local town ring, with waypoint helpers registered for normal runtime cleanup. Full Campaign Debug adds `town_police_patrol.contract.runtime`, proving a temporary enemy town activates a dedicated town-police group, retains the patrol route, receives patrol-cycle waypoints, and cleans up the fixture. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r115-town-police-patrols`.

Latest r114 undercover live-equipment follow-up: undercover clothing and weapon eligibility now prefers live runtime evidence before falling back to prefab/name identity. Equipped clothing slots are scanned for civilian versus military gear, the character weapon manager blocks current/equipped weapons, carried inventory is recursively checked for weapon or explosive entities, and every result still resolves to explicit eligibility reasons. Full Campaign Debug adds `undercover_identity_gate.contract.runtime`, proving civilian identity remains eligible while military character, weapon item, and military gear identities block the fallback gates. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r114-undercover-live-equipment-gates`.

Latest r113 enemy local-front follow-up: enemy commander target scoring now filters rival or neutral targets that are not operationally connected to the acting faction. Same-faction defensive targets remain valid, resistance-held targets remain valid as the explicit exception, and rival/neutral targets need either a linked zone or a same-faction foothold within the local-front radius before they can become live support/capture orders. Direct enemy order queueing uses the same gate, and target scoring reports local-front reject counts plus the first rejection reason. Full Campaign Debug extends `enemy_target_scoring.contract.runtime` with `enemy_target_scoring.local_front_gate`, proving a far disconnected rival target is rejected while a far resistance-held target remains eligible. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r113-enemy-local-front-gate`.

Latest r112 roadblock support and commander handoff follow-up: player roadblock support now uses the map-target support flow, requires a selected stored HQ vehicle, consumes that garage vehicle, spends HR from the planned FIA crew size, and establishes a vehicle-safe road checkpoint instead of routing like a QRF. Enemy roadblock orders physicalize through the support request path, and established roadblocks for resistance, occupier, and invader factions publish visible map markers with player-facing labels. Commander vacancy handling now prefers connected members when the commander disconnects. Campaign schema 41 persists selected roadblock garage-vehicle metadata on support requests. Full Campaign Debug adds `support.request.roadblock_support`, `roadblock.markers.all_factions.runtime`, `authorization.commander_disconnect_handoff.runtime`, and Phase 23 UI proofs for stored-vehicle roadblock gating. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r112-roadblock-support-handoff`.

Latest r111 town-police prefab follow-up: enemy-owned town garrison activation now resolves town-police groups through dedicated HST group prefabs for sizes 2, 3, 4, and 5. The US and USSR variants inherit their normal faction group bases and populate their slots with randomized soldiers from the owning enemy faction, so active town security no longer falls back to generic patrol/fireteam groups for this role. Full Campaign Debug extends `force_composition.contract.runtime` with `force_composition.town_police_prefabs`, proving size-specific US and USSR town-police composition selection. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r111-town-police-prefabs`.

Latest r110 town-security pressure follow-up: income/resource ticks now also settle police and roadblock pressure through the town influence pipeline. Hot enemy-held towns drift one step at a time toward higher police/roadblock presence based on heat, occupier support margin, and war level, while resistance-held towns shed enemy security pressure unless heat is extreme. The changes write `security_pressure` town influence rows plus matching compact `town_influence` strategic-event rows whose summary carries the pressure context. Full Campaign Debug adds `town_influence.security_pressure.runtime`, using an isolated fixture state to prove enemy pressure growth, resistance security relief, income-cadence execution, compact strategic-row visibility, report visibility, and save-data preservation. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r110-town-security-pressure`.

Latest r109 radio-town influence follow-up: income/resource ticks now apply bounded radio tower political drift through the existing town influence pipeline. The nearest resistance-held radio tower within range gently raises FIA support, lowers occupier support, improves reputation, and cools heat; enemy-held towers apply the inverse pressure. Radio influence writes normal `radio_broadcast` town influence rows and matching compact `town_influence` strategic-event rows, and radio-only changes still trigger campaign save/marker refresh. Full Campaign Debug adds `town_influence.radio.runtime`, using an isolated fixture state to prove friendly and hostile broadcasts, income-cadence execution, compact strategic-row visibility, and report visibility. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r109-radio-town-influence`.

Latest r107 commander-transfer choice proof follow-up: Phase 23 UI coverage now builds a synthetic member roster with one commander plus eight eligible transfer targets, then asserts the Members payload still exposes one `Transfer commander` chooser action carrying at least eight encoded choices. This turns the prior manual verification that commander transfer is not capped at six into a one-button regression guard. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r107-transfer-choice-proof`.

Latest r106 map-open gate proof follow-up: the rendered map-marker owner-client proof now opens the native map itself when needed, records whether the proof opened it, and closes only proof-owned map menus after sampling. Full Campaign Debug also adds `command_ui.map_open_gate`, an owner-client case that opens the native map, attempts both the input-toggle and direct command-menu open paths, and asserts the command menu remains closed with no visible root while the map stays open. The synchronized runtime/build labels are now `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r106-map-open-gate-proof` and `2026-07-08-menu-input-r19-map-open-gate-proof`; a fresh run should prove the prior r105 map-open refusal instead of leaving it as static-only.

Latest r105 command-menu input follow-up: the command menu now rejects new open attempts while the native in-game map is already open. The shared toggle path covers custom action, native `PlayerMenuInvite`, and raw `KC_I` polling, and the direct `OpenMenu` path has the same guard; closing an already-open command menu is still allowed. The client-side command-menu build tag is now `2026-07-08-menu-input-r18-native-map-open-gate`. This is static-validated only until a fresh client run proves `reason=map open` refusal while the map is open.

Latest r104 global mission-notification follow-up: mission events, mission intel refreshes, and general notification toasts now fan out through every connected player's owner request bridge instead of relying on one server-side broadcaster component. New mission, mission outcome, and convoy movement events keep using the centralized mission event payload, but delivery is now explicit per player, which should remove the inconsistent one-client-only notification behavior seen in multiplayer. Full Campaign Debug now records `mission_notifications.global.contract.runtime`, proving connected-player request-bridge coverage plus created, convoy-moving, completed, failed, and expired mission notification flags. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r104-global-mission-notifications`.

Latest r103 gun-shop delivery follow-up: Gun Shop now uses the `gun_shop` runtime primitive instead of the cargo placeholder. It spawns a stationary civilian seller at the mission marker, opens through the seller context/menu action, builds random runtime stock from available arsenal/catalog items, caps purchased shop time to fifteen minutes when more remains, applies no reward or expiry penalty, and only spawns the HQ delivery vehicle if at least one item was purchased. Delivery vehicles are marked as non-garageable, map markers follow the seller/delivery vehicle with player-facing labels, and Full Campaign Debug now treats `gun_shop` as a typed primitive by opening the shop, buying one item, asserting the fifteen-minute cap, expiring the shop, waiting for delivery, and checking arsenal deposit. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r103-gun-shop-delivery`.

Latest r102 player-facing command-menu follow-up: visible Command Menu main sections now hide technical prefab/resource/position/group/request IDs and translate HQ pressure, defense state, support recall teams, garrisons, garage vehicles, capture rows, and the activity feed into player-facing labels. Detailed debug/report actions still keep technical evidence for troubleshooting. Full Campaign Debug Phase 23 now asserts the support recall chooser hides internal group IDs while showing support type, FIA count, deployment status, and relative location, and it verifies the HQ/Petros main section no longer exposes prefab, raw position, or attacker-group rows. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r102-player-facing-command-menu`.

Latest r101 support-recall/costs follow-up: paid Command Menu actions now show their money and HR costs before use, QRF/search player support spends HR equal to the planned FIA infantry count, and active support teams can be recalled through a selectable list that shows support type, squad/group id, live member count, and relative location. Recalled support routes toward an exit outside the render bubble and refunds HR only for surviving FIA who make it out. The shared action-choice modal is now scrollable with dynamic rows, so commander promotion/selection and support recall are no longer capped to six visible options. Campaign schema 39 persists support HR/recall fields, and Full Campaign Debug adds support HR-cost assertions, a recall/refund runtime probe, and Phase 23 UI assertions for visible paid costs plus the support recall chooser. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r101-support-recall-costs`.

Latest r100 civilian-traffic/mission-UI follow-up: active Missions tab rows are compacted to one row per active mission, with detailed mission inspection remaining behind the existing mission summary/inspect actions. Civilian town runtime now assigns spawned pedestrians to CIV AI groups with cyclic wander waypoints, adds configurable civilian-driven ambient traffic through `civilianDrivingVehicleCountPerTown`, seats spawned civilian drivers, assigns cyclic traffic routes, and deletes traffic cars plus driver/group/waypoint helpers when they leave the player render bubble. The repeated spawn-sweep debug line now only emits during forced diagnostics or actual spawn work. Full Campaign Debug Phase 20 now asserts pedestrian behavior helpers, traffic counts, traffic driver/route helpers, and cleanup; Phase 23 now asserts the compact active-mission row contract. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r100-civilian-traffic-mission-ui`.

Latest r99 vehicle-report strategic-event follow-up: runtime vehicle reports now bracket the existing `HST_CivilianService.RegisterVehicleHeat()` mutation with durable `vehicle_reported` strategic-event rows. `HST_StrategicEventState` now carries vehicle runtime id, heat before/after/delta, reported before/after, and report-expiry delta under campaign schema 38, while the normal vehicle heat state continues to block undercover vehicle cover. Full Campaign Debug upgrades `undercover_vehicle_heat.contract.runtime` to assert the first vehicle report event, the passenger-exposure vehicle report event, strategic report visibility, save-data roundtrip preservation, and cleanup. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r99-vehicle-report-strategic-event`.

Latest r98 support-near-HQ strategic-event follow-up: hostile non-resistance support requests that resolve within the HQ exposure radius now record a durable `support_near_hq` strategic-event row before applying a modest HQ-knowledge gain. The support service resolves the normal support outcome first, then brackets the HQ knowledge mutation through `HST_StrategicService.BeginSupportNearHQEvent()` and `CompleteStrategicEvent()` so the source request, target zone/faction, applied flag, and HQ-knowledge delta survive save-data copies. Full Campaign Debug now records `support_near_hq.strategic_event.contract.runtime`, using an isolated copied campaign state to prove hostile supply support resolution, garrison reinforcement, the applied `support_near_hq` event, save-data roundtrip preservation, and cleanup. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r98-support-near-hq-strategic-event`.

Latest r97 convoy-outcome strategic-event follow-up: mission-specific convoy outcomes now bracket their existing outcome branches with durable strategic-event rows. `HST_ConvoyOutcomeService` records `convoy_arrived`, `convoy_crew_eliminated`, `convoy_vehicle_captured`, `convoy_cargo_delivered`, and `convoy_expired` rows, using the convoy asset id as the source when an asset caused the branch and the actual support town as the target when support changes. Full Campaign Debug now records `convoy_outcome.strategic_event.contract.runtime`, using an isolated copied campaign state to prove prisoner-convoy captive delivery, HR/support reward deltas, the applied `convoy_cargo_delivered` event, save-data roundtrip preservation, and cleanup. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r97-convoy-outcome-strategic-event`.

Latest r96 mission-expiry strategic-event follow-up: normal mission expiry now routes through `HST_StrategicService.ApplyMissionExpiryEvent()` instead of applying aggression directly from the mission tick. `HST_MissionService.Tick()` only marks missions expired, tracks the ids that expired during that tick, the coordinator applies those `mission_expired` rows once, and the HQ defense mission is excluded from the generic expiry penalty because its timer expiry resolves as a successful defense. Full Campaign Debug now records `mission_expiry.penalty.contract.runtime`, using an isolated copied campaign state to prove tick-driven expiry, aggression-only penalty, no reward payout, durable strategic-event deltas, save-data roundtrip preservation, and cleanup. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r96-mission-expiry-strategic-event`.

Latest r95 zone-capture strategic-event follow-up: resistance zone captures now bracket the real `CaptureForResistance()` path with a durable `zone_captured` strategic-event row. The event begins before the owner flip and completes after resistance garrison seeding, aggression gain, counterattack evaluation, and linked-town support, so the row captures owner before/after, capture-progress reset, aggression, resource, and support deltas from the actual capture path. Full Campaign Debug Phase 17 now tags the capture event with the debug prefix, asserts exactly one applied `zone_captured` event, verifies owner/progress/aggression deltas, and proves save-data roundtrip preservation. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r95-zone-capture-strategic-event`.

Latest r94 settings-comments follow-up: runtime settings schema is now 18 and generated `HST_Settings.json` files include JSON-safe `_comment` and `_comment_*` fields explaining nearby settings. The loader continues to scan only known gameplay keys and ignores the explanatory fields, so existing profile settings migrate by rewriting the generated file with comments while preserving known scalar values. Foundation validation now requires the settings comments and the schema-18 contract. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r94-settings-comments`.

Latest r93 HQ knowledge/response-count follow-up: passive HQ knowledge now uses a smaller inner exposure radius than general HQ threat reporting. Enemy activity is threat-visible at 850m but only knowledge-relevant inside 700m, nearby civilian heat is threat-visible at 1050m but only knowledge-relevant inside 850m, passive knowledge checks run every 300s, require 45 local knowledge-threat, and add at most 1 knowledge per scan. Full Campaign Debug now asserts that an outer-radius hostile group raises HQ threat without revealing HQ knowledge. Routed support/QRF/Petros attack groups reapply `EMovementType.RUN` on every route tick, set tight response formation spacing, and also set each live AI character's wanted movement to RUN so delayed-populated groups do not keep walking. Active groups with runtime entities now reconcile spawned/live member counts from actual living agents and repair editable group membership; support and Petros attack debug assertions now require nonzero runtime member counts and native RUN movement, not just a `response_run` string token. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r93-hq-knowledge-response-counts`.

Previous r92 HQ pressure/response pacing follow-up: passive HQ awareness is now less eager, with enemy activity scanned at 1000m and nearby civilian heat at 1250m. Global enemy aggression still contributes to HQ threat reporting, but it no longer increases HQ knowledge or updates local HQ activity by itself; passive knowledge gain now requires local HQ exposure, is checked on a 180s cooldown, and is capped at 2 per passive scan. Background-war HQ pressure uses a 1000m threat zone, target scoring ignores HQ pressure while HQ knowledge is zero, and opportunistic Petros attacks now require at least 25 HQ knowledge instead of triggering from proximity alone. Defend Petros attackers stage in a closer 760-1120m HQ band, with normal placement requesting 850-1120m, and routed support/QRF/Petros attack groups force `EMovementType.RUN` while recording `response_run` in their active-group mode. Full Campaign Debug now asserts global-aggression no-leak passive knowledge, the zero-knowledge no-Petros gate, the Petros staging band, and support/attacker `response_run` proof. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r92-hq-pressure-response-pacing`.

Previous r91 strategic-event pipeline follow-up: mission success and failure consequences now flow through `HST_StrategicService.ApplyMissionOutcomeEvent()` instead of coordinator-local outcome helpers. The service records durable `HST_StrategicEventState` rows with mission, target zone, target faction, applied status, money/HR, town-support, capture-progress, aggression, enemy-resource, HQ-knowledge, and owner before/after deltas. `HST_CampaignSaveData` now copies the strategic-event ledger under schema 37, Full Campaign Debug asserts completion/failure event rows plus save-data roundtrip preservation, the baseline report includes `strategic events`, and prefixed debug cleanup removes event rows linked to debug mission/source ids. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r91-strategic-event-pipeline`.

Latest r90 mission-target physicalization follow-up: active non-convoy mission primitives now force their target zone through physical activation even when every player is outside that zone's render bubble. Mission-owned active groups are treated as mission runtime projections instead of garrison population: they are excluded from garrison accounting, fold-back, and normal zone deactivation cleanup, then cleaned when the owning mission is no longer active. Full Campaign Debug now records `render_bubble.mission_target.force_physical`, starts a `rescue_pows` mission against a far inactive zone, and asserts far-player setup, forced zone activation, mission asset handles, mission guard group handles, and cleanup. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r90-mission-target-force-physical`.

Previous r89 garrison proof follow-up: the garrison fold-back runtime case now preserves the real pre-test garrison counts separately from the arranged cap-fixture counts, so cleanup restores the campaign exactly after proving capped survivor return. The same case now also asserts that direct `AddAbstractForces()` writes clamp infantry to the zone slot cap before fold-back runs, covering the player recruitment/add path and the active-group survivor return path in one button. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r89-garrison-cap-cleanup-proof`.

Previous r88 map-target cursor follow-up: support, supply, garrison recruit, and garrison removal map-target confirmations now draw a passive selected-target cursor above the confirmation/count dialog layer. The overlay is independent from native map selection, ignores cursor/focus, and is cleared on choose-again, cancel, confirm, or map close so the selected click point stays visible without stealing Confirm/Cancel input. Full Campaign Debug Phase 23 now asserts the selected-target cursor layer is above action dialogs. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r88-map-target-cursor-layer`.

Previous r87 support/garrison/convoy marker follow-up: support and garrison map-target commands still use the normal gameplay map, but garrison recruitment now prompts for FIA count before final confirmation, confirmation names the resolved campaign location when available, and map-target requests reopen the Forces menu after dispatch. Player-requested resistance ground support has no default cooldown; air support still uses the air cooldown setting. QRF abstract resolution no longer supplements garrisons, and fold-back/garrison writes cap infantry by zone slots. Resistance support live markers refresh from actual runtime group/vehicle positions and terminal support groups force marker cleanup. Town, base, and radar/radio zone markers now use distinct non-QRF icons while resource nodes stay unchanged. Convoy recovery no longer teleports observed living crew back into vehicles after contact/full dismount, and occupied hostile runtime vehicles eject players without assigning a faction claim to the vehicle. Captive context actions now expose only the next valid captive action. Full Campaign Debug now extends `enemy_order_resolution.contract.runtime` with QRF-no-garrison proof and `garrison.foldback.contract.runtime` with capped-return proof. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r87-support-garrison-convoy-marker-fixes`.

Previous r86 Petros relocation follow-up: Petros now owns the contextual HQ relocation flow instead of the normal command-menu payload. His final selectable context action starts as `Relocate HQ`; on use, the server sets Petros into follow mode, broadcasts `Petros is following <player name>`, sends the followed player the owner-only relocation hint, and keeps Petros synced into the player's vehicle cargo seats when possible. The same action becomes `Deploy HQ Here` for the followed player and moves HQ to Petros' standing position, then restores Petros as a stationary HQ NPC. Full Campaign Debug now records `hq.petros.relocate_action_last` against the real Petros action manager. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r86-petros-relocation-flow`.

Previous r85 command-menu follow-up: the Petros/HQ command menu no longer exposes HQ relocation actions. Initial HQ placement is handled by the setup map and later campaign work should not offer the old hardcoded hideout move buttons in the normal menu. The backend move methods remain for direct/contextual/debug paths, but the visible Petros payload now only keeps HQ reporting and asset rebuild controls. Full Campaign Debug phase 23 records `phase23.ui.no_hq_move_menu_actions`, and foundation validation rejects reintroducing the visible `Move HQ` menu rows. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r85-hide-hq-move-menu-actions`.

Previous r84 settings follow-up: runtime settings schema is now 17 and removes the generated `campaign.defaultHideoutId` key. The setup map is the source of truth for initial HQ placement, so `HST_Settings.json` no longer stores or loads a default hideout id and the Setup tab no longer displays one. Existing schema-16 profiles migrate by rewriting the generated settings file without the obsolete key while preserving the remaining scalar settings. Foundation validation now fails if the removed settings field or JSON key returns. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r84-settings-hideout-key-removal`.

Previous r83 map-target support follow-up: commander support and garrison actions now open the normal in-game fullscreen map, use map click selection plus a confirmation dialog, and submit `map_target` arguments back through the existing server-authoritative visible-command path. The Forces payload disables map-target support/recruit/remove actions with `map required` when the caller has no `EGadgetType.MAP` gadget in inventory, and the server revalidates the map before executing. Player-requested ground support uses the clicked map position as the destination, stages 220m+ away through dry/road-aware placement, rejects spawn points near living players or active AI groups, and then routes the spawned support group toward the selected destination. Full Campaign Debug now asserts map-target UI visibility/gating, support destination linkage, support spawn offset, player/AI clearance, and the support-specific placement contract. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r83-map-target-support-deploy`.

Previous r82 location/QRF marker follow-up: static strategic location markers now avoid the QRF tactical `OBJECTIVE_MARKER` visual. Towns, base/outpost/seaport/airfield locations, and mission-site bookkeeping anchors use non-QRF icons, while QRF/attacker markers keep `OBJECTIVE_MARKER`. Phase 23 marker audit now records `phase23.marker.location_qrf_icon_deconflict` and fails if static town/base/mission-site zone markers reuse the QRF icon. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r82-location-qrf-marker-deconflict`.

Latest r81 relation-order follow-up: the latest visible server artifact still loaded r72, with hard failures unchanged in physical-response route waypoint assignment and native marker publication. `HST_EnemyCommanderService.ResolveOrderTypeForDebug()` now exposes the protected commander order resolver for controlled debug fixtures without changing normal commander ticks. The one-button `enemy_target_scoring.contract.runtime` case now adds `enemy_target_scoring.relation_order_types`, using isolated relation zones to prove resistance-held targets choose counterattack, same-faction damaged holdings choose QRF, same-faction weak garrisons choose rebuild, same-faction towns choose roadblock, and rival-held enemy zones choose support call instead of same-faction defense behavior. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r81-relation-order-decision-proof`.

Latest r80 relation/unclaimed-vehicle follow-up: the latest visible server artifact still loaded r72 and reproduced two current priorities: stale runtime vehicle ownership/faction cleanup blocks and enemy/pressure systems that need explicit relation semantics. `HST_FactionRelationService` now centralizes same/resistance-enemy/rival/neutral relation checks, enemy resource/pressure/targeting loops only process configured enemy factions, target scoring records owner relation, and the one-button `enemy_target_scoring.contract.runtime` fixture now proves resistance-held, same-faction, and rival-held zones score through distinct components including `rival_enemy_pressure`. Runtime vehicle unclaiming now uses recursive vehicle-root detection through `HST_VehicleRootPolicy.ClearVehicleFactionAffiliationRecursive*()`, and physical-war faction repair audits vehicle claims recursively so spawned vehicles remain usable by players instead of being reclaimed by faction repair. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r80-relation-unclaimed-vehicle-proof`.

Latest r79 enemy-target-scoring follow-up: enemy commander target selection now builds an explainable scored-candidate result instead of scoring inline during the weighted roll. Hideout and mission-site bookkeeping anchors are excluded from target candidates, top-band weighted selection favors the strongest strategic candidates, and `BuildEnemyTargetScoreReport()` exposes selected/best zone ids, scores, weights, eligibility counts, and component reasons. The one-button baseline now records `enemy_target_scoring.contract.runtime`, using an isolated scoring state to prove a high-value resistance airfield wins while a low-value owned town remains lower and high-priority bookkeeping anchors are excluded. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r79-enemy-target-scoring-proof`.

Latest r78 support-attacker marker follow-up: the latest visible server artifacts still loaded r72, so convoy and marker findings from that run must be retested against the newer build chain. The still-relevant Phase 22 cleanup warning exposed a marker/backing classification issue: `hst_defend_petros_attackers` is a QRF-style tactical marker, but its linked backing state is the live attacker active group created by the Petros attack support request, not a QRF row. Marker generation now suppresses that attacker marker for terminal/despawned groups, cleanup/backing audits accept non-terminal active-group backing for QRF-style markers, and Phase 22 now rebuilds marker state after support physicalization and asserts the attacker marker link/backing explicitly. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r78-support-attacker-marker-backing`.

Latest r77 convoy movement-window follow-up: the one-button early convoy sample now waits beyond the normal convoy route-reissue threshold before recording the phase4-8 movement/readiness report. The departure action output records the controlled movement wait in seconds, and the wait now covers the initial progress samples plus the first no-progress recovery opportunity before the runner teleports the player for contact. This should make `convoy.movement.stall_timeout`, route reissue, vehicle usage, and distance-closure evidence meaningful in one run instead of sampling only a short pre-recovery window. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r77-convoy-movement-window`.

Latest r76 convoy AI vehicle follow-up: convoy route assignment now registers the spawned vehicle with the crew group's `SCR_AIGroupUtilityComponent` through the vehicle's `SCR_AIVehicleUsageComponent` before adding runtime route waypoints. If the vehicle lacks a valid/pilotable AI usage component, the route assignment now fails with that exact reason instead of reporting a generic no-movement condition. The one-button convoy physical probe now records `convoy.vehicle_usage.*` assertions so the next report can distinguish seated-driver readiness, waypoint assignment, AI vehicle registration, and actual movement progress. A fresh run should show `partisan-live-runtime-proof-r76-convoy-ai-vehicle-usage`.

Latest r75 convoy seating follow-up: the latest server artifact was still on r72 and reproduced convoy readiness warnings: crew groups and unclaimed convoy vehicles existed, but every convoy reported zero seated drivers and therefore zero assigned movement waypoints. `HST_ConvoyVehicleControlAdapter` now tries `SCR_CompartmentAccessComponent.MoveInVehicle()` before the animated `GetInVehicle()` fallback, preserves seating-pending evidence after accepted move-in requests, and spreads unseated crew around the convoy vehicle before each bind attempt. Initial convoy spawn, delayed crew-population bind, staging retries, and route-reissue recovery now all relocate unseated crew beside the vehicle before requesting driver binding. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r75-convoy-seat-bind`.

Latest r74 cleanup-population follow-up: post-case and final cleanup now try to resolve pending native active-group population through the primary `CampaignDebugResolvePendingActiveGroupPopulation()` path before recording faction, direct-fallback, and population-settled assertions. The runtime faction audit no longer double-counts groups that are still explicitly `spawn_pending_agents` or AIWorld-deferred; it skips those as pending-population rows and leaves the `runtime_group_population_settled` assertion responsible for any unresolved empty group roots. Cleanup artifacts now include a `population drain` evidence line plus resolved-count metrics, and foundation validation rejects direct-fallback cleanup drains or missing drain coverage. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r74-cleanup-population-drain`.

Latest r73 route/marker proof follow-up: the server run on r72 reached the richer curated map but exposed two hard proof gaps: physical response route assignment could race pending native group population inside the one-button command, and native marker publication still stopped at the old 96-marker budget. `HST_PhysicalWarService.CampaignDebugResolveActiveGroupRouteAssignment()` now bridges the debug route proof through native population resolution, production direct-infantry fallback when the delayed callback has not fired, and the normal move/sweep waypoint writer before the fold-back assertion runs. Native marker budgets are raised to 192 total and 48 tactical records in both the marker service and desired-marker director, and foundation validation guards both contracts. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r73-route-marker-proof`.

Latest r72 unclaimed-vehicle follow-up: HST-spawned vehicles now clear engine faction affiliation at spawn and repair time instead of being stamped as owned by the source faction. Vehicle prefab selection still uses the relevant faction/source catalog, but convoy, active-group, mission-carrier, garage-redeploy, persistence-restore, civilian, and debug carrier entities are spawned unclaimed so players can enter and use them. Physical-war runtime faction audits now prove group roots and crews match their active-group faction while linked vehicles remain unclaimed, and foundation validation rejects reintroducing direct vehicle faction stamping. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r72-unclaimed-runtime-vehicles`.

Latest r71 civilian-pool follow-up: civilian ambience now uses the stock randomized CIV character prefab as the single default civilian character resource in both the balance config and runtime catalog fallback. Civilian vehicles now default to the CIV faction entity catalog instead of named config/catalog fallback lists, while retaining the existing internal last-resort spawn fallback if catalogs are unavailable. `HST_CivilianService` now accepts one GUID-qualified civilian character prefab as a valid pool, and foundation validation rejects reintroducing explicit clothing-variant civilian prefab lists or default named civilian vehicle fallback pools. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r71-randomized-civilian-pool`.

Latest r70 compile-fix follow-up: the curated location upsert helper now respects Enforce's 16-argument method cap by deriving composition/spawn metadata inside the helper instead of passing those as extra call-site arguments. Mission-site taxonomy anchors still resolve to `spawn_none`, so radar/bookkeeping locations stay non-garrison runtime anchors. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r70-enforce-upsert-arg-cap`.

Latest r69 support-tracking/location-taxonomy follow-up: player-requested resistance support groups now get a persistent live support marker linked to the spawned active group, controlled by `features.trackResistanceSupportGroupsOnMap` and defaulting on in runtime settings schema 16. The support runtime probe now snapshots marker state after physical group population and after terminal fold/resolution, so the one-button suite warns when a spawned resistance support group lacks a live marker or when a terminal group still has one. The Everon location catalog now applies a curated upsert layer over the existing extra zones: core towns remain towns, power/logistics/fuel/farm/sawmill sites are resources, industrial plants are factories, radio towers are radios, and radar sites are mission-only bookkeeping zones without start garrisons. Preflight now asserts curated minimum zone counts and known-ID category contracts. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r69-support-tracking-location-taxonomy`.

Latest r68 response-mixed-vehicle follow-up: vehicle-capable physical responses now persist the selected active-group vehicle prefab, spawn a linked runtime vehicle entity under the active support/QRF group id when the infantry group becomes live, and keep that vehicle entity owned by the same cleanup path. Campaign schema 36 adds the durable active-group vehicle prefab. The one-button physical-response proof now requires a vehicle-capable composition, linked runtime vehicle evidence before fold-back, and save-data roundtrip preservation of the selected vehicle prefab. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r68-response-mixed-vehicle`.

Latest r67 response-sweep-waypoint follow-up: routed support/QRF infantry now uses a mixed waypoint chain: patrol waypoints for route legs and a final search/sweep waypoint at the target. The physical-response proof now requires both `infantry_waypoints` and `infantry_sweep` spawn-mode evidence, so the one-button debug suite proves target sweep intent instead of only proving movement-chain assignment. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r67-response-sweep-waypoints`.

Latest r66 response-infantry-waypoint follow-up: routed support/QRF active infantry groups now spawn real AI waypoint chains from generated route positions once the runtime group is populated. Physical-war cleanup tracks and removes those waypoint entities with the group, while `m_iAssignedWaypointCount` now represents assigned infantry route waypoints for this path. The one-button physical-response fold-back proof forces pending native population when needed and asserts the `infantry_waypoints` route mode plus assigned waypoint count. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r66-response-infantry-waypoints`.

Latest r65 response-route follow-up: routed active groups now resolve generated route waypoint chains when their route id or target zone has a generated route, record the computed waypoint count on `HST_ActiveGroupState`, and continue to fall back to direct source-target movement when no route is available. Physical support deployment now prefers generated target-zone route ids, QRF physicalization preserves generated route ids, and the physical-response fold-back debug case seeds an isolated generated route fixture before proving waypoint-count evidence and save-data roundtrip preservation. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r65-response-route-waypoints`.

Latest r64 response deployment follow-up: physicalized support now persists deployment route id, placement type/summary, target/road/HQ distance evidence, road resolution, vehicle-safe result, and vehicle-safe requirement on the support request. Vehicle-capable support requires vehicle-safe staging and downgrades to infantry-only staging only when vehicle-safe placement is specifically unavailable. Linked active groups now retain the composition vehicle count for original/survivor accounting, and the one-button physical-response fold-back proof asserts route/placement linkage, vehicle-safe staging when vehicles are present, and save-data roundtrip preservation. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r64-response-deployment-proof`.

Latest r63 attack/support spend split follow-up: enemy commander orders now separate proactive attack pressure from reactive defense/support spending. Proactive background-war attacks and Petros pressure spend attack pool only, while capture-triggered counterattacks, QRFs, rebuilds, roadblocks, and direct enemy support calls spend support pool through the ledger gate. The one-button debug suite now asserts support-only QRF spend/refund, support-only capture counterattacks, and one-pool commander spending. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r63-attack-support-spend-split`.

Latest r62 population-outcome follow-up: default campaign outcomes now use population support plus all-airfield control for victory and killed population greater than one third for loss. Runtime settings schema 15 adds population outcome toggles, campaign schema 34 persists terminal population/support/airfield metadata, and the one-button Phase 24 suite arranges neutral, victory, and catastrophe population fixtures before proving save-data roundtrip preservation. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r62-population-outcome-proof`.

Latest r61 Workbench compile follow-up: Workbench rejected the category mission selector failure helper because it assigned a newly allocated `HST_MissionCategorySelectionResult` into a non-strong helper parameter. The helper now follows the compile-proven result-helper pattern: allocate a local failure result when called with null, otherwise mutate and return the caller-owned result. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r61-category-selection-compile-fix`.

Latest r60 runtime-debug follow-up: commander mission selection now exposes mission categories instead of per-town mission starts. Selecting a category chooses a valid mission definition in that category and a random eligible target inside the configured mission-selection radius, which defaults to the configured player event/render bubble. Runtime settings schema 14 adds `world.playerRenderBubbleRadiusMeters` and `world.missionSelectionRadiusMeters`, and the one-button baseline now records `mission_category_selection.contract.runtime`. The latest server debug failures were also addressed by making force-composition war-tier cost scale, snapshotting cleared vehicle heat before later reheat, reusing debug mission-carrier runtime records when immediate physical vehicle scans miss the moved carrier, accepting authoritative captive carrier association when the native compartment state is not visible in the same frame, downgrading stochastic post-contact AI casualty absence to WARN, and resetting debug-only enemy support ledgers before phase 18/19 seed probes. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r60-category-mission-selection-debug-fixes`.

Latest r59 Workbench compile follow-up: Workbench rejected the `Fail()` helpers in the force-composition and spawn-placement services because they assigned a newly allocated result object into a non-strong result parameter. Those helpers now return a freshly initialized local failure result when called with null, and otherwise mutate the caller-owned result. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r59-result-strong-ref-compile-fix`.

Latest r58 Workbench compile follow-up: r57 introduced a duplicate coordinator helper declaration for enemy-order lookup, which caused Workbench Game script compilation to fail before runtime. The coordinator now keeps one shared `FindCampaignDebugEnemyOrderInState()` helper and the enemy-order resolution proof calls that shared helper for save-data roundtrip checks. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r58-enemy-order-compile-fix`.

Latest r57 enemy-order resolution follow-up: the one-button Full Campaign Debug baseline now records `enemy_order_resolution.contract.runtime` between the support-spend and physical-response proofs. The case seeds isolated debug outpost/town targets, queues garrison-rebuild and roadblock orders through the enemy commander spend gate, resolves those named orders without forcing unrelated active campaign orders to resolve, proves the garrison reinforcement and roadblock-pressure outcomes, proves resolved order/garrison/town state survives `HST_CampaignSaveData.Capture()`/`ApplyTo()`, and restores the debug zones, orders, ledgers, garrison, civilian row, and enemy resource pool. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r57-enemy-order-resolution-proof`.

Latest r56 active-group source-link follow-up: active groups now persist durable source identifiers for mission, support-request, garrison, and QRF ownership plus original infantry/vehicle force counts. Save-data migration backfills original counts and reconstructs links from support requests, QRF records, active mission guard/convoy ids, or garrison zone ids. The one-button Full Campaign Debug physical-response foldback proof now asserts that a physicalized support group records its support request id and original force size before save/load, and the garrison foldback proof seeds and roundtrips a garrison-source group with original force counts. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r56-active-group-source-links`.

Latest r55 mission failure follow-up: the one-button Full Campaign Debug baseline now records `mission_failure.penalty.contract.runtime` beside the mission completion proof. The case seeds a single debug `support_city_supplies` active mission against an existing town, fails it through the real coordinator `FailMission()` wrapper, proves failed status, no money/HR reward payout, configured occupier aggression penalty, deterministic town-support penalty, save-data roundtrip preservation of failed mission/economy/town/aggression state, and cleanup restoration of the mission row plus original economy/town/pool values. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r55-mission-failure-proof`.

Latest r54 mission completion follow-up: the one-button Full Campaign Debug baseline now records `mission_completion.reward.contract.runtime`. The case seeds a single debug `support_city_supplies` active mission against an existing town, completes it through the real coordinator `CompleteMission()` wrapper, proves succeeded/completed status, exact configured money/HR rewards, deterministic town-support outcome, save-data roundtrip preservation of mission/economy/town state, and cleanup restoration of the mission row plus original money/HR/town support/owner. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r54-mission-completion-proof`.

Latest r53 garrison fold-back follow-up: the one-button Full Campaign Debug baseline now records `garrison.foldback.contract.runtime` after the broader physical-response fold-back proof. The case seeds a single debug active support group with explicit survivor infantry/vehicle counts, drives it through `HST_PhysicalWarService.FoldActiveSupportGroup()`, proves those survivors return to the selected abstract garrison, proves the folded active-group status and returned garrison strength survive `HST_CampaignSaveData.Capture()`/`ApplyTo()`, and restores the original garrison counts before continuing. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r53-garrison-foldback-proof`.

Latest r52 garrison persistence follow-up: the early garrison recruit/remove one-button case now captures an in-memory save-data roundtrip immediately after the real commander recruit command and before the cleanup remove command. The case now proves the recruited abstract infantry, unchanged vehicle count, spent money/HR, and current schema survive `HST_CampaignSaveData.Capture()`/`ApplyTo()` for the selected resistance garrison. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r52-garrison-save-roundtrip`.

Latest r51 garage-vehicle heat handoff follow-up: garage vehicles now carry the same durable reported/heat state, civilian-cover eligibility, report expiry, last report metadata, and passenger compromise counts as runtime vehicles. Vehicle capture copies runtime heat into the stored garage record before deletion, garage redeploy restores that metadata onto the spawned runtime vehicle, and save-data migration/backfill now covers stored garage vehicles as schema 32. The one-button Full Campaign Debug garage/loadout case now seeds a hot civilian-cover garage vehicle, redeploys it through build mode, captures it back into garage, and proves store -> runtime -> capture -> save-copy heat preservation. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r51-garage-vehicle-heat-handoff`.

Latest r50 undercover-vehicle follow-up: runtime vehicles now carry durable reported/heat state, civilian-cover eligibility, report expiry, last report metadata, and passenger compromise counts. `HST_CivilianService` can report, clear, and inspect vehicle heat independently from player wanted heat, and vehicle exposure with a runtime id now marks the vehicle hot before compromising the passenger. The one-button Full Campaign Debug baseline now records `undercover_vehicle_heat.contract.runtime`, proving civilian vehicle cover eligibility, reported-vehicle cover blocking, clear-to-cover restoration, passenger exposure reporting, player compromise, report output, save-data roundtrip preservation, and cleanup of the probe vehicle/player rows. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r50-undercover-vehicle-heat`.

Latest r49 town-influence follow-up: town support changes wrote durable `HST_TownInfluenceEventState` rows and kept population and modifier aggregates on each civilian town. That historical authority shape is superseded by sealed Schema 64, where events mutate one canonical town record and civilian fields are projections only. The r49 assertion name and expected artifact remain historical evidence, not proof of the Schema-64 boundary.

Latest r48 physical-response follow-up: physical enemy response now has an explicit fold-back path when a QRF/search support group leaves the active event bubble. The support lifecycle folds survivors into abstract garrison state through `HST_PhysicalWarService`, removes the live runtime group handle, resolves the support through the physical terminal path, and lets the linked enemy order apply its one-time survivor refund. The one-button Full Campaign Debug baseline now records `enemy_physical_response.foldback.runtime`, proving enemy order -> support request -> active group linkage, active-group staging state, out-of-bubble survivor fold-back, linked order resolution, and save-data roundtrip preservation of the folded order/support/group records. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r48-physical-response-foldback`.

Latest r47 enemy-support-spend follow-up: enemy support/QRF spending now goes through a per-faction/per-zone support ledger with recent damage pressure, same-zone stack cooldowns, max defense spend caps, and survivor fold-back refunds. Enemy commander orders, active-zone QRF dispatch, and direct enemy support requests share the same defense gate, and the enemy resource report now includes ledger spend, cooldown, refund, and last-decision reasons. The one-button Full Campaign Debug baseline now records `enemy_support_spend.contract.runtime`, proving damage-signal ledger creation, QRF resource debit, cooldown denial, max-spend denial, and survivor refund cleanup. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r47-enemy-support-spend`.

Latest r46 spawn-placement follow-up: HST now has a data-only spawn placement request/result contract for physicalization source and target planning. Physical support uses `HST_SpawnPlacementService` before creating active groups, so failed placement reports a clear runtime reason instead of silently falling back to unsafe source positions. The one-button Full Campaign Debug baseline now records `spawn_placement.contract.runtime`, proving QRF outpost staging road/dry validation, HQ-attack safe-radius standoff, convoy source/destination dry-ground reporting, and explicit invalid-request failure reasons. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r46-spawn-placement-suite`.

Latest r45 force-composition follow-up: HST now has a data-only force request/result contract that turns faction, intent, war level, budget, manpower bounds, vehicle permissions, and capability requests into serializable group/vehicle plans. Support request physicalization consumes this contract for its infantry group plan and records the composition intent, tier, summary, cost, manpower, and planned vehicle counts on the support request and linked active group; mission guard groups and garrison activation probes now consume the same result shape. The one-button Full Campaign Debug baseline now records `force_composition.contract.runtime`, proving US/FIA/USSR composition coverage, US regular QRF composition at war level 1 and 5, vehicle-disabled output, invalid-prefab failure/skipping, unsupported helicopter/artillery capability failure, support/mission/garrison consumers, and support/enemy-order/active-group composition serialization before downstream runtime support/order probes run. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r45-force-composition-suite`.

Latest r44 editable-group membership follow-up: the unpacked AI mods rechecked so far follow the vanilla pattern of spawning an `SCR_AIGroup` root and letting native group member creation create real agents, then cleaning up through `GetAgentsCount()` plus delayed spawn queue state rather than treating custom fallback members as primary proof. HST still preserves that primary path, and now reconciles the Game Master editable hierarchy after active-group population: every controlled `AIAgent` is checked for an editable child parented under the displayed `SCR_EditableGroupComponent`, missing parent links are repaired with `SetParentEntity()`, and a living agent is promoted with `SetNewLeader()` if the group has no living leader. Survivor cleanup also waits when the native group is still initializing or has queued delayed members. Runtime evidence now reports server agent count, leader presence, and editable-parented member counts beside `editableSize`, so the next server or single-player run can prove whether Game Master Size 0 is a client/editor replication symptom or a real missing group membership path. A fresh run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r44-editable-group-membership`.

Latest r43 primary group cleanup follow-up: the latest dedicated-server debug artifacts showed r42 loaded, admin granted through the server-listed admin path, native US group population working, but persistence smoke convoy records triggered direct fallback crew repair and then poisoned 239 post-case primary-spawn cleanup assertions. Active groups whose members were gone also left empty Size 0 group roots visible in Game Master because HST keeps `SCR_AIGroup` roots non-deleting while delayed native population is pending. Current code marks persistence smoke convoy groups as data-only, skips physical convoy crew repair for smoke sentinels, queues a primary stock group respawn before convoy crew repair can fall back, and explicitly unregisters/deletes terminal empty group roots while preserving dead character bodies. A fresh server run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r43-primary-group-cleanup`; terminal group cleanup logs should report deleted group roots and preserved dead members instead of leaving active Size 0 group icons behind.

Latest r42 stamina-setting follow-up: Partisan now has runtime settings schema 13 with `features.infiniteStaminaEnabled`, defaulting to true for generated and migrated settings. The authoritative server setting is sent to the owning client through the existing player-controller request bridge; the owner refills its local `CharacterStaminaComponent` and suppresses only `SCR_StaminaBlurEffect` so sprint exhaustion does not show the dark vignette/radial blur while infinite stamina is enabled. A fresh Workbench/server run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r42-infinite-stamina-setting` and the owner setting sync line before stamina behavior is considered current.

Latest r41 native-population route-proof follow-up: the newest runtime logs showed the FIA shell issue was gone for HST active groups; stock US/FIA roots populated through native delayed spawn events shortly after the same-frame debug assertions had already failed. Current code preserves semantic spawn modes such as `petros_attack_support` while appending primary spawn proof tokens, skips route normalization for support-created active groups, and lets campaign-debug pre-route proof drain an existing stock `SCR_AIGroup` delayed queue through `SpawnAllImmediately()` before movement assertions. This keeps direct faction-infantry fallback out of certification while making support, Phase 17 counterattack, physical-combat, and Phase 22 Petros attack probes judge durable native agents instead of a transient pending root. A fresh server or single-player run should show `2026-07-07-runtime-proof-r41-native-population-route-proof` before population/route results are considered current.

Latest r40 Workbench compile follow-up: Workbench compile failed because the owner-client map marker proof called `SCR_MapMarkerEntity.GetRootWidget()`, which is not available in the current Arma Reforger script API. The proof now only counts player marker widget readiness while the map is open through the HST modded `EnsureHSTPlayerMarkerWidget()` path, removing the unsupported native call. A fresh Workbench compile or runtime run should show `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r40-map-proof-compile-fix` before map-proof results are considered current.

Latest r39 Petros/primary-population follow-up: old r29 runtime evidence showed Petros repeatedly falling out of the HQ service handle while the debug suite then failed `hq.runtime_objects.flag`, and support/Defend Petros probes could also force direct faction-infantry fallback while trying to prove route movement. Current code treats exactly-one living world Petros near the HQ slot as the source of truth for HQ runtime readiness and reattaches the cached handle before spawning again. Campaign-debug pre-route population now tries native finalization, native `SpawnUnits()` retry, and stock member-slot population only; if those primary paths have not produced live agents yet, the group remains pending with explicit evidence instead of switching to direct fallback for certification. A fresh server or single-player run should show `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r39-petros-world-primary-population` before any HQ or active-group result is considered current.

Latest r38 conflict-marker source fix: the stock conflict-base prefab was rechecked and still carries inherited FIA ambient patrol spawnpoints, so HST no longer uses it as the source prefab for generated capturable markers or hideout markers. Current marker layers now use `HST_ConflictMarkerBase.et`, a stripped HST-owned prefab with the same campaign/base/map/supply surface components and no ambient patrol children. Static validation now fails if HST marker or hideout layers reference the stock conflict base, the FIA ambient patrol prefab, or the old inherited child IDs. A fresh server or single-player run should show `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r38-stripped-conflict-markers` before any Game Master AI/faction result is considered current.

Latest r37 build-provenance follow-up: the repository previously had structured `HST_BuildInfo` stamped as r36 while the coordinator's legacy authority boot/admin string still reported r35. Runtime build identifiers were synchronized in r37 and are now advanced together by the r38 stripped-conflict-marker build, so the next server log and generated campaign-debug report can be matched without ambiguity.

Date: 2026-07-05


Verdict: not fully implemented.

Startup stability note: post-22:01 debug verification slices were backed out after Workbench hit a native crash during Game script validation. Workbench now loads again; reintroduced slices should stay small, debug-only, and Workbench-validated before being counted as closed.

Latest proof-policy follow-up: the latest inspected full-run artifact still had empty build provenance fields and the expected hard failures around HQ rebuild classification plus convoy physical crew/vehicle proof, so it should be treated as stale diagnostic evidence rather than proof of the current package. Current code now adds per-assertion proof metadata (`proofLevel`, `observedPath`, `requiredPath`, and `countsTowardCertification`) plus a derived certification summary in the run JSON/summary. This separates raw PASS/WARN totals from the subset of assertions that actually certify runtime behavior. This slice is static-validated only until a fresh dedicated server/client run writes non-empty build provenance and the new certification line.

Latest r14 convoy-driver/menu follow-up: the latest inspected r10 convoy artifacts showed vehicles and direct-fallback crew could exist while readiness stayed blocked on `waiting for animated AI boarding to seat a driver`, so route waypoints and movement never became valid proof. Current code now gives server-spawned convoy AI a server-authoritative compartment move-in path, refreshes compartment occupancy immediately after seat orders, and keeps driver availability as a real seated-driver assertion. The admin menu now exposes one obvious full-suite action, `Run Full Campaign Debug`, with narrower actions labeled as scoped debug profiles. The rendered command-menu owner-client proof now accepts Enfusion `1`/`0` bool report fields and no longer requires hidden-by-design optional widgets as readiness gates. This is static-validated only until a fresh dedicated server/client run proves the r14 build line, command-menu rendered proof, and convoy driver/waypoint/movement rows.

Latest r15 GM/captive proof follow-up: current code now separates GM budget gameplay policy from native editor diagnostics. Missing `SCR_BudgetEditorComponent` diagnostics report as `BLOCKED` diagnostic evidence outside certification, while `preflight.gm_budget.policy` plus `preflight.gm_budget.disabled_spawn_probe` own the live disabled-budget proof. The temporary captive boarding/transport probe now mirrors the convoy seating fix by trying the server-authoritative compartment move-in path before animated boarding, recording bounded seat-state sample counts, and failing the boarding/transport proof if no seated/getting-in state is visible after the rescan. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r15-gm-captive-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh Workbench compile and dedicated server/client run prove the r15 build line and updated rows.

Latest r16 faction-proof follow-up: current code now makes the global runtime-faction audit attempt the existing direct faction-infantry repair when an active spawned infantry group has only an empty runtime shell. If the group still has no live controlled members during the population grace, the audit records that as an unproven live-count failure instead of passing only because there are no member entities to mismatch. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r16-strict-faction-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh Workbench compile and dedicated server/client run prove the r16 build line and updated faction rows.

Latest r17 Workbench compile follow-up: Workbench reported `Undefined function 'HST_PhysicalWarService.ResolveEntityPrefabName'` in the runtime faction visual-evidence path. Current code adds the missing class-local prefab-name helper to `HST_PhysicalWarService` and bumps the server runtime build line to `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r17-physicalwar-compile-fix`. This is static-validated only until Workbench compiles the Game scripts with no HST `SCRIPT (E)` rows.

Latest r18 Workbench compile follow-up: the next Workbench reload reported `Undefined function 'AIGroup.GetFactionName'` in the same runtime faction visual-evidence path. Current code casts the root as `SCR_AIGroup` before calling `GetFactionName()` and bumps the server runtime build line to `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r18-scr-aigroup-compile-fix`. This is static-validated only until Workbench compiles the Game scripts with no HST `SCRIPT (E)` rows.

Latest r19 visual-faction follow-up: a fresh server/single-player check showed spawned zone AI appearing as FIA when enemy zones should have produced US or USSR soldiers. Current code stops using the FIA-default `HST_RuntimeEmptyGroup` root for US/USSR direct infantry fallback, adds US/USSR-specific empty group roots, makes group faction assignment idempotent so repeated survivor/audit ticks do not keep resetting the group container, and treats a wrong visual character prefab path as a runtime faction mismatch even if the faction component was stamped to the expected key. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r19-faction-visual-spawn-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh Workbench compile and in-game Game Master inspection prove enemy active groups spawn with US/USSR character prefabs.

Latest r20 direct-member proof follow-up: runtime faction visual evidence now reports direct fallback member counts and a direct member prefab sample before the empty group-root sample. Wrong visual character prefabs are still counted even if the direct member is not currently considered living, so a spawned FIA character under a US/USSR active group cannot be hidden by a liveness race. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r20-direct-member-visual-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh runtime run shows `directSample` prefab evidence for enemy active groups.

Latest r21 primary group-spawn follow-up: direct faction-infantry population is no longer treated as a successful proof path for normal active infantry groups. Physical-war group spawning now suppresses stock `SCR_AIGroup` auto-member spawning, configures the group root first, then calls native `SpawnUnits()` as the controlled primary path. Campaign-debug pre-route resolution no longer forces direct fallback, faction audits no longer repair empty group shells while measuring, and post-case/final cleanup now fail active groups tagged with `direct_infantry_fallback`. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r21-native-group-primary-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh Workbench compile and server/single-player run prove enemy active groups use stock US/USSR group member prefabs without fallback-tagged rows.

Latest r22 global primary-method follow-up: fallback behavior is now documented as degraded runtime evidence, not success. Mission runtime visibility now fails active mission fallback/failure instead of downgrading it to WARN, mission runtime spawn proof requires `m_bRuntimeFallback == false` even for `abstract_fallback`, and the active-group direct fallback assertions from r21 remain hard certification checks. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r22-global-primary-method-proof`. This is static-validated only until the next runtime artifacts show fallback rows failing or blocking certification rather than passing primary-method assertions.

Latest r23 stock-slot primary follow-up: Game Master `Size 0` green group icons over enemy capturable zones were traced to empty `SCR_AIGroup` roots, not to GUID-prefixed prefab paths selecting the wrong source. Current code now treats the stock group prefab's own `m_aUnitPrefabSlots` as the next primary population path when `SpawnUnits()` drains with zero controlled members, records AIWorld budget/slot/queue diagnostics, and reports `slotPrimary` separately from direct fallback in campaign-debug evidence. Direct faction-infantry fallback remains degraded evidence. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r23-stock-slot-primary-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh Workbench compile and server/single-player Game Master check prove US/USSR groups have live stock slot members instead of empty roots.

Latest r24 group-faction follow-up: the latest inspected runtime report was still `r22`, but it proved the live symptom from Game Master: active groups expected as US/USSR had runtime group roots reporting FIA. Current code now stamps `SCR_AIGroup` roots through a single helper that follows the native pattern: use `InitFactionKey()` while the group key is empty before agent attachment, then use `SetFaction()` only when a non-empty root still needs reconciliation. Runtime faction logs now include the group-root change method when a root changes. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r24-group-faction-init-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh Workbench compile and server/single-player Game Master check prove blue-zone groups report US and red-zone groups report USSR instead of FIA.

Latest r25 Game Master faction follow-up: stock US/USSR group prefab paths and GUID-qualified resources were verified against unpacked base data and are not the apparent source of the FIA group icons. Current code now forces a server `SCR_AIGroup.SetFaction()` broadcast during controlled group spawn, finalization, stock-slot population, and direct fallback replacement, and rejects a stock group root that still reports the wrong faction before native `SpawnUnits()` runs. A wrong-faction root is now a primary spawn failure with explicit debug output instead of a misleading empty FIA group. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r25-group-faction-broadcast-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh Workbench compile and server/single-player Game Master check prove blue-zone groups report US and red-zone groups report USSR instead of FIA.

Latest r26 root-faction/HQ proof follow-up: Game Master may display the group root's entity affiliation as well as `SCR_AIGroup.GetFactionName()`, so active-group faction repair now stamps and audits both the native group faction and any root `FactionAffiliationComponent`. Runtime visual evidence now prints `groupFaction` and `rootFaction`, and forced `SetFaction()` broadcasts count as explicit proof lines instead of silent side effects. HQ runtime recovery now reattaches existing world cache/arsenal/tent/spawn-point entities before respawning them, and `m_bHQRuntimeObjectsSpawned` only becomes true when Petros plus all four HQ objects are uniquely world-proven. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r26-root-faction-hq-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh Workbench compile plus server/single-player Game Master check prove enemy group roots and HQ runtime objects are correct.

Latest r27 Game Master root-faction follow-up: saved-state inspection showed the live profile had US-owned zones and active US/USSR groups with BLUFOR/OPFOR prefab paths, so the green FIA Game Master cards are not explained by strategic owner state or GUID-prefixed resource paths. Current code now makes HST empty runtime group roots inherit the vanilla faction-specific base groups (`Group_FIA_Base`, `Group_US_Base`, `Group_USSR_Base`) so direct fallback/debug roots carry the same editable UI faction and military-symbol metadata as stock groups. Physical-war infantry spawning also emits `active group runtime proof` lines with zone owner, expected faction, selected prefab, catalog/resource checks, status/mode, counts, and root/member visual evidence. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r27-gm-faction-root-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh Workbench compile plus server/single-player Game Master check prove enemy group roots display US/USSR instead of FIA.

Latest r28 Petros group-spawn follow-up: the fresh r27 server log loaded the current build and proved admin SteamID64 grants plus US stock member prefabs for sampled active groups, but Petros repeatedly spawned, attached to a synthetic AI group, and was removed before the next HQ lifecycle tick. Current code now makes `HST_PetrosGroup.et` inherit the FIA base group and own a single Petros unit slot. HQ runtime spawning uses the native group-owned path (`SpawnUnits()` then resolve the controlled Petros agent) as the primary method, treating delayed group member creation as pending evidence instead of a failed standalone character spawn. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r28-petros-group-spawn-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh Workbench compile plus server/single-player run prove Petros remains visible/alive at HQ without recurring removal retries.

Latest r29 AIWorld budget follow-up: the r27 server log proved native active-group population was blocked by `AIWorld limited 262/256 canAdd no`, so empty group roots could appear in Game Master while `SCR_AIGroup.SpawnUnits()` was denied by the engine budget. Current code now raises an HST physical-war AIWorld limit floor before native member spawning, records AIWorld budget counters in active-group proof lines, gates stock-slot/direct repair paths through the same budget check, and marks/removes empty roots as `spawn_deferred_aiworld_budget` instead of leaving visible zero-member groups when budget still cannot be reserved. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r29-aiworld-budget-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh Workbench compile plus server/single-player run prove US/USSR active groups populate through native group/member-slot paths without empty FIA-looking roots.

Latest r30 HQ rebuild settle follow-up: the r29 server log proved US/USSR active groups were now populating through native member prefabs and that Petros reattached successfully one runtime tick after the HQ rebuild command, but `hq.rebuild_command` still asserted in the same frame as the rebuild request. Current code splits the HQ debug stage so the rebuild is requested, the runner waits one runtime tick, `EnsureRuntimeObjects()` runs again, and the rebuild case asserts the settled world scan for Petros, cache, arsenal, tent, and spawn point. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r30-hq-rebuild-settle-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh Workbench compile plus server/single-player run prove `hq.rebuild.settled_world_scan` and `hq.runtime.flag_stabilizes` pass with one living Petros.

Latest r31 stock-group/Petros-target follow-up: the latest Game Master symptom points at empty active-group shells being visible before stock `SCR_AIGroup` member population, while the server log proved delayed US/USSR member prefabs can appear shortly afterward. Current code now follows the vanilla ambient-patrol primary path for stock groups: spawn the faction-authored group prefab normally, confirm the prefab's native root faction, set delete-empty/max-units/member-delay, and call `SpawnUnits()` only when `GetSpawnImmediately()` is false. It no longer suppresses native spawn or forces a group-faction broadcast before member evidence exists. Phase 22 Petros attack support groups are also tagged so static-route normalization cannot overwrite their HQ/Petros target with the nearby bookkeeping zone. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r31-stock-group-petros-target-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh Workbench compile plus server/single-player Game Master check prove enemy zone groups populate as US/USSR without lingering FIA-looking zero-size roots, and `phase22.attack.group_target_base_position` passes.

Latest r32 active-group pending-proof follow-up: the newest available dedicated/client logs still predate r31/r32 and loaded r29, but they prove why the activation diagnostics were misleading. Zone activation printed `activation partial` in the same frame where stock `SCR_AIGroup` roots were still `spawn_pending_agents`, then the same log showed native delayed US/USSR members populate shortly afterward. Current code now reports `activation pending native population` with pending infantry/group counts while native member creation is still outstanding, and reserves `activation partial` for cases where no pending native infantry remains. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r32-active-group-pending-proof`. This is static-validated only until the next fresh runtime log proves pending enemy groups settle into live US/USSR members or produce a true zero-agent failure with no pending shell ambiguity.

Latest r34 stuck-pending population follow-up: the active-group pending loop no longer waits forever for a native delayed queue that stays `IsInitializing()`/queued without producing live agents. After the stock native group and stock member-slot attempts, direct faction-infantry repair can replace the stuck empty root even while native delayed population still reports active, and campaign-debug pre-route evidence now records `directFallback` plus whether native delayed population was still active before that repair. Direct fallback remains degraded evidence, not primary success. The server runtime build line is now `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r34-stuck-pending-population-proof`. This is static-validated only until a fresh runtime log proves US/USSR zone groups either populate through stock members or produce explicit `directFallback`/zero-agent failure evidence instead of lingering as empty FIA-looking shells.

Latest r35 pending-population certification follow-up: the newest available debug artifact still loaded r29, so it cannot certify the current r34/r35 code. Current code now promotes unresolved active-group population to explicit post-case and final cleanup certification evidence: `post_cleanup.runtime_group_population_settled` and `cleanup.runtime_group_population_settled` count any non-terminal infantry group still in `spawn_pending_agents` or `spawn_deferred_aiworld_budget`, with group id, zone, expected faction, selected prefab, runtime status/mode, live member count, failure reason, and visual root/member evidence. A fresh runtime run should load `2026-07-06-runtime-proof-r35-pending-population-certification`; if any default zone group remains an empty root, the one-button report should block on that exact group instead of leaving the Game Master symptom ambiguous.

Latest r36/r38 conflict-base ambient-patrol follow-up: the Game Master screenshot symptom has a separate primary cause from HST active-group spawning. Stock `ConflictMilitaryBase.et` carries inherited FIA ambient patrol children. r36 tried disabling those inherited children in placed layers; r38 replaces that fragile layer override with `HST_ConflictMarkerBase.et`, which does not contain ambient patrol children. Active-group visual evidence still prints `editableSize` and `editableFaction`, matching the values Game Master uses for group Size/Faction. If green Size 0 groups remain after loading the r38 authority line, the next log can distinguish HST-tracked pending roots from non-HST vanilla/editor group shells.

The current `Run Campaign Debug` implementation is a useful certification scaffold. It is no longer just a string/report smoke runner: it has typed results, deterministic debug run prefixes, artifacts, status/cancel/cleanup commands, stronger bootstrap/preflight/HQ/economy assertions, convoy readiness/progress probing, a controlled convoy phase-chain state-machine probe, mission primitive action probes, POW captive free/follow/extraction plus temporary boarding/transport probes, seeded persistence smoke roundtrip assertions including a restore-eligible field-vehicle sentinel, a render-bubble zone activation probe, a timed physical AI combat/contact probe, town support up/down mutation assertions, civilian runtime population and bounded movement-sample assertions, QRF/search support route sampling/arrival/terminal-resolution assertions, Phase 24 pacing/escalation/end assertions, and mission cleanup checks.

It does not yet satisfy the full pasted contract for a complete one-button in-game verification suite. Large areas remain partial state/runtime probes or are not represented at all.

## Completion Verification Snapshot

Source contract rechecked against the current campaign-runtime-integrity delivery
gate. Historical checkpoint details remain below for diagnosis, but the Current
Runtime Evidence section above supersedes their totals.

Current verification result: **not complete and not safe to rerun on live state**.
The admin controls, profiles, typed result layer, structured artifacts, prefixed
cleanup, and many scoped probes are implemented. The latest run nevertheless
ended at 367 PASS, 61 WARN, 218 FAIL, and 17 BLOCKED; 201 failures cascaded from
one leaked defense mission, while marker-root exceptions and genuine physical
failures remain. Implementation breadth must not be reported as certification.

Evidence checked in code:

- Schema-49 operation authority: `HST_OperationService` and persisted
  `HST_OperationRecordState` integrate exact paid-QRF confirmation, queue,
  handoff, arrival, restore, recall, terminal settlement, migration, and archive
  boundaries. This inspection is not a fresh Full Campaign Debug, packaged
  runtime, or process-restart result.
- Admin UI/dispatch: `admin_run_campaign_debug [smoke|physical|full]`, `admin_campaign_debug_status`, `admin_campaign_debug_cancel`, and `admin_campaign_debug_cleanup` are in command coverage, visible admin actions, and coordinator dispatch.
- Result/artifact harness: `HST_CampaignDebugRunResult`, `HST_CampaignDebugCaseResult`, `HST_CampaignDebugAssertion`, and `HST_CampaignDebugMetric` exist and are used by `RecordCampaignDebugCase`; run artifacts are written as JSON, summary, and state-diff files.
- Stage conversion: bootstrap, preflight, HQ runtime, economy/income/training, support, generated content, persistence smoke, mission start/runtime/cleanup, primitive probes, render bubbles, garrison, civilian aid, support cancel, garage/loadout, Phase 14-24, and cleanup leak checks emit typed cases.
- Recent render-bubble closure: Run Campaign Debug now records `render_bubble.zone_activation.early`, `render_bubble.mission_asset.expired_player_bound`, and `render_bubble.convoy.expired_contact`.
- Recent convoy state-machine closure: Run Campaign Debug now records `convoy_phase_chain.controlled_state_machine`, which creates temporary convoy records, exercises the real physical-war phase helpers through staging, moving, contact, and eliminated, asserts objective progress/completion, and removes the temporary records before recording the case.
- Recent loadout apply closure: the early garage/loadout case now records `loadout_editor.valid_apply`, `loadout_editor.invalid_apply`, `loadout_editor.physical_apply`, `loadout_editor.live_draft_apply`, `loadout_editor.physical_restore`, `loadout_editor.live_draft_restore`, and `loadout_editor.apply_cleanup` using transient saved loadouts, the real member apply command, finite arsenal/issued-ledger deltas, physical player-inventory counts, server-side live-draft slot model counts/locations, invalid no-mutation checks, and restoration of the debug-touched saved-loadout, arsenal, issued-ledger, player inventory, and editor-session state. The physical probe now preflights live inventory capacity and reports `BLOCKED` when the controlled player has no cargo-capable storage, because a magazine-only non-serialized loadout should correctly fail with `Inventory Full` in that state.
- Current HQ arsenal action-order follow-up: the HQ service now builds a runtime action-surface report from the spawned arsenal `ActionsManagerComponent`, classifies disabled inherited actions, the HST Loadout Editor action, and the HST HQ menu action, and the HQ runtime debug case records `hq.arsenal.loadout_editor_first`. This assertion is `PASS` only when the first selectable runtime action is the Loadout Editor, `FAIL` when another selectable action sorts ahead of it, and `BLOCKED` only when no controlled player exists for visibility/performability checks. This is static-validated only until the next dedicated server/client run proves the new `Partisan HQ arsenal actions` evidence row.
- Recent failed-action closure: Phase 23 failed-action coverage now treats invalid HQ move, invalid zone mission start, and invalid mission completion as strict PASS/FAIL negative-path assertions. It requires explicit failure reason text, aggregate rejection, tracked count no-mutation, and wider before/after state snapshot equality instead of marking the sample as warning-level merely because it is a negative path.
- Recent marker-audit fix: Phase 23 zone marker position assertions now compare map placement in X/Z with tolerance instead of exact 3D vector equality, because marker presentation height is resolved through the map marker service. The checkpoint's all-zone position mismatch should be fixed by code, but still needs a fresh runtime run.
- Recent campaign-debug follow-up fixes: transport/area primitive, render-bubble, and civilian-population probes now recover or block on controlled-player liveness before real mission interactions, so an earlier physical probe cannot cascade into misleading `player is not alive` cargo/area failures. Current-schema save-data restore now preserves schema-19+ vehicle source metadata instead of reclassifying every runtime vehicle from prefab, and garage redeploy keeps explicit source flags on the runtime vehicle record. Phase 17 capture smoke now avoids zones gated by incomplete `conquest_` missions before expecting direct force-progress capture, and its linked counterattack group spawn assertion now treats async `spawn_pending_agents` population as WARN/pending evidence instead of a hard failure. The enemy-order physical probe context now carries the group status after physicalization/spawn so the Phase 17/22 pending checks compile under Workbench reload. Phase 21 apply-undercover smoke now resets transient player heat/compromise/detection/scan/eligibility state before using the controlled eligibility fixture. Pending AIGroup population now gets a bounded multi-attempt grace window instead of deleting the group after the first empty one-second callback. Generated road-route validation and generated-site road fallback now treat a nearby road-resolved vehicle footprint as sufficient route/site safety instead of failing on a redundant dry-ground probe. These fixes are static-validated, but still need a fresh Workbench/runtime run before this audit can count the affected failures as closed.
- Recent captive-follow gameplay fix: the captive follow controller and runtime fallback now use the base-game entity-follow waypoint (`AIWaypoint_Follow.et` plus `SCR_EntityWaypoint.SetEntity`) before falling back to a static patrol waypoint. Same-target `StartFollowing()` calls now pulse the existing controller instead of returning early, and repeated no-progress ticks apply a bounded direct catch-up step that logs `direct catch-up after stalled follow`. The checkpoint logs showed `RequestFollowPathOfEntity` failing and the old static waypoint fallback not proving distance closure; this change keeps the waypoint bound to the moving player or vehicle, applies the native close-follow formation displacement, and gives stalled follow behavior a visible recovery path. This is static-validated, but still needs a fresh Workbench/runtime run before the rescue follow failures can be counted as closed.
- Recent AIGroup population fix: physical-war active groups that spawn with zero agents now subscribe to `SCR_AIGroup.GetOnAllDelayedEntitySpawned()` and retry finalization as soon as the native delayed member-spawn list drains, while retaining the bounded timed retry fallback. The checkpoint logs repeatedly showed `AIGroup` prefabs with zero agents after a short grace window, which polluted render-bubble, support, garrison, phase-route, and area primitive evidence. This is static-validated, but still needs a fresh Workbench/runtime run before those physical infantry failures can be counted as closed.
- Workbench reload follow-up evidence: the referenced `logs_2026-07-04_10-23-10` folder contains stale 12:01 and 12:05 script-validation failures for missing `m_sGroupStatusAfterTick`, followed by a 12:07 script reload segment with no HST `SCRIPT (E)` or `Can't compile` lines. That proves the enemy-order physical-probe context-field repair survived Workbench script validation at that point. It does not prove the later captive-follow entity-waypoint or native delayed-AIGroup fixes, which still need a fresh Workbench/runtime run.
- Recent harness-noise fix: early-mechanics steps that emit typed cases no longer also emit generic action/observation classifier rows for the same returned text. This removes duplicate red rows such as `action.mechanic_render_bubble_zone_activation`, `action.mechanic_civilian_aid`, and `observation.mechanic_garage_vehicle_loadout_reports`; the dedicated typed cases remain the source of truth.
- Latest 14:09 debug-run follow-up fixes: the referenced `logs_2026-07-04_14-09-29` run completed with `PASS 389`, `WARN 176`, `FAIL 5`, `BLOCKED 1`, and no script/error log entries. The remaining hard failures mapped to stale generated-content route/site state, convoy start planning that could miss sparse road-network anchors, generic-objective dynamic primitive completion, and an over-strict Phase 24 order-count monotonicity assertion. The blocked loadout row still represents a real no-cargo-capacity precondition. Current code statically fixes the hard failure categories and forces a final player-marker refresh after campaign-debug cleanup for manual map inspection, but a fresh Workbench/runtime run is still required before this audit can count them closed by runtime evidence.
- Latest dedicated-server/client follow-up: the provided July 5 UTC server/client logs showed setup HQ placement completing, HQ cache/arsenal/tent/spawn-point spawning, the arsenal loadout action working, but Petros immediately falling out of HQ runtime tracking and the native setup bootstrap path hitting a `SCR_FreeSpawnHandlerComponent.AssignEntity_S` null `playerController` VM exception during a connect race. Current code gates native spawn requests on a ready player controller, reattaches/prepares Petros as a stationary HQ NPC before respawning, exposes an HQ menu action on the arsenal as a command-menu fallback, and explicitly colors setup zone-label `TextWidget`s black. These are static-validated and require a fresh server/client run before the audit can count them closed by runtime evidence.
- Latest two-player membership/input follow-up: the referenced 23:42 server/client logs showed `rno` was the first connected commander and `h` joined second as session player id `2` with backend identity `518d3fb7-2613-40b5-bf21-cb206ede7684`. The non-commander status was expected for that run, but the second player was not recognized as a member because new players only defaulted to member when they were the first registered record. The client command-menu component reported `inputRegistered=1 customBinding=1`, but no `HST_CommandMenu`, raw `KC_I`, or refused-input logs appeared, which pointed to the custom action lacking an active action context. Current code defaults new players to members while preserving explicit guest removals, resolves/migrates real backend identities from early `workbench_player_N` placeholders, refreshes registration before visible-menu snapshots/commands/permission checks, bridges `serverconfig.json` listed admins through the native player admin checks, defines and activates `HST_CommandMenuContext` for the `I` key action, closes the loadout editor on the first Escape/menu-open press without letting that same press open the native pause menu, and requires Petros runtime proof to be the real prepared Petros character rather than an HQ action-surface fallback. These are static-validated and require a fresh server/client run before the audit can count them closed by runtime evidence.
- Latest production-parity follow-up: the referenced July 5 `logs_2026-07-05_00-11-57` dedicated server/client evidence showed normal campaign services ticking during HQ setup, zone activation spawning non-FIA active groups before setup confirmation, and native `AIGroup` delayed-spawn events draining with zero agents for garrisons, support, QRFs, mission guards, and convoy crews. Current code prevents mission/economy/physical-war/civilian/runtime ticks while `HST_CAMPAIGN_SETUP` is active, adds service-level active-phase guards to physical-war zone activation, mission target activation, and mission convoys, and treats an empty dedicated-server `AIGroup` after `SCR_AIGroup.IsInitializing()` clears as a server fallback case: physical war now spawns verified faction infantry character prefabs directly, assigns the intended faction, joins them to the `SCR_AIGroup`, tracks them under the same runtime group id, and avoids double-counting when the group later reports agents. The loadout editor Escape guard also now resets `MenuBack`/`MenuOpen` actions and dismisses any native pause menu opened by the same Escape press across a short retry window, because the HST editor is a widget overlay rather than a native `MenuBase`. These fixes are static-validated only and require a fresh dedicated server/client run before the audit can count them closed by runtime evidence.
- Latest 00:58 campaign-debug/server-client follow-up: the referenced full debug run produced `PASS 400`, `WARN 162`, `FAIL 10`. The server console proved direct fallback convoy crews were created as US infantry, then the convoy entered contact and eliminated crews while `convoy_seating_pending` still said the animated AI boarding/driver bind was pending. Current code treats convoy crew population and seating as a bounded pending-control state, blocks contact/survivor elimination while that state is still fresh, and makes readiness/debug assertions WARN only during that grace. Runtime faction application now stamps the spawned `SCR_AIGroup`, controlled agents, direct fallback members, active vehicles, and convoy vehicles with the intended faction to address the report that spawned AI appeared as FIA. The `I` command menu path now consumes duplicate raw/action input in the same frame and logs action/raw key edges plus UI-root refusal reasons. The loadout editor now registers a `PauseMenuUI.m_OnPauseMenuOpened` guard so an Escape press closes the editor and dismisses any native pause menu opened by the same input before a later Escape can pause normally. Phase 22 report assertions now accept a clean Defend Petros success before the report checkpoint and prove HQ knowledge through persisted outcome/order resolution instead of only the last reason string. The stale `SetPriorityLevel()` captive waypoint calls were removed after Workbench reported the API as unavailable on `AIWaypoint`. Setup-map location labels were already black through `HST_MapZoneOverlayUIComponent.SETUP_ZONE_LABEL_TEXT_COLOR = 0xFF111111`; the client log also showed player marker widget creation succeeded, so the post-run missing-player-marker report still needs another manual map check. These fixes are static-validated only and require a fresh Workbench/dedicated server-client run before this audit can count them closed by runtime evidence.
- Latest physical-combat probe follow-up: the early mechanics sweep now adds a two-step `physical_combat.ai_contact` case. The start step creates temporary resistance and enemy active groups inside the controlled player's render bubble, assigns search-and-destroy waypoints toward each other, and lets the normal physical-war tick sample them for a 45-second window. The result step records factions, native faction hostility, runtime group existence, live-count start/min/end, sample history, final distance, contact-distance evidence, casualty-resolution evidence, and cleanup. Contact setup is PASS/FAIL; after mutually hostile populated groups are sampled, missing live-count loss is a hard FAIL instead of WARN because spawned AI that never damages either side did not prove combat behavior. This still does not close natural mission area-clearing combat by itself. This slice is static-validated and requires a fresh Workbench/dedicated server-client run before the audit can count the new case by runtime evidence.
- Latest Defend Petros targeting follow-up: Petros attack support markers now label their target as `HQ/Petros` instead of the nearby bookkeeping zone, and Phase 22 now asserts that the Petros attack order, linked support request, linked attacker group, dynamic defense mission, objective, and task all target the HQ/Petros base position within tolerance. The nearby zone ID remains valid bookkeeping/source context for duplicate guards and source lookup, but it is no longer allowed to masquerade as the actual attack target in reports or debug evidence. This slice is static-validated only and requires a fresh Workbench/dedicated server-client run before the audit can count it closed by runtime evidence.
- Latest AIGroup force-fallback follow-up: the 00:58 server log showed some empty `AIGroup` prefabs stayed `spawn_pending_agents` through all retry attempts because `SCR_AIGroup.IsInitializing()` never cleared, so support/QRF/convoy/debug groups could still fail even though the direct faction-infantry fallback worked for other groups. Physical-war spawning now keeps the native delayed-spawn path first, but after a bounded retry threshold it forces the direct faction-infantry fallback even while the native group still reports initializing. This is a game/runtime fix for support, render-bubble, QRF, mission guard, counterattack/Petros, and convoy crew groups; it is static-validated only until the next runtime run.
- Latest active-group fallback-diagnostics follow-up: the July 5 16:52 runtime run predates the later 17:18/17:24/17:35 commits, but it exposed why this needs better proof: many normal active groups reached `spawn_failed` with only a generic `zero agents after grace` line. The pending-population path now preserves the last native `SpawnUnits()` or direct faction-infantry fallback skip/failure reason in the final warning, including missing runtime group handles, non-`SCR_AIGroup` handles, initialization blocking, replacement-group failure, or zero spawned replacement infantry. This is static-validated and needs the next server/client run to prove every remaining zero-agent failure has an actionable cause.
- Latest Petros/faction/budget proof follow-up: the July 5 16:52 logs showed Partisan admin granted, Petros repeatedly spawned then fell out of runtime tracking, direct faction fallback working for some US groups but normal active groups still failing zero-agent population, and continued GM budget clamp/correction noise. Current code now preserves a living prepared Petros character as the hard HQ runtime proof, records `hq.petros.ai_group` as WARN-level diagnostic evidence, forces direct faction infantry fallback earlier, pre-balances disabled GM budget cap/current headroom before preflight, throttles deficit correction spam, and audits live runtime group/vehicle faction mismatches in post-case/final cleanup. These are static-validated and require a fresh Workbench/dedicated server-client run before the audit can count them closed by runtime evidence.
- Latest convoy proof cleanup follow-up: the referenced full-run summary showed multiple convoy physical failures where `pending grace 1` was recorded but per-asset `convoy.crew_entity.*` assertions still failed immediately. Current code keeps aggregate convoy readiness strict after grace expires, but missing crew-entity handles are WARN while the convoy population/seating window is explicitly pending. The same pass fixes lockstep removal order for runtime group id/entity arrays, runtime vehicle id/entity arrays, pending population arrays, and blocked vehicle zone/reason arrays, because removing the key/id array first can leave final sibling entries behind and corrupt later runtime-handle proof. Convoy physical case ids now include the runner label so movement/readiness and contact windows for the same convoy instance produce distinct evidence rows. This is static-validated only until the next runtime run.
- Latest cleanup-snapshot follow-up: the referenced full-run summary warned only because active group count rose from run start, which is weaker than the cleanup contract. Current code keeps total active group count as a metric but asserts the stronger invariant instead: no `hst_debug_` prefixed persisted state and no active group without zone, mission, support-request, enemy-order, or QRF backing. This prevents normal backed campaign activity during a long run from being reported as a leak while still failing true orphan groups.
- Current implementation follow-up: the later server/client logs proved Partisan player marker widgets were created for both connected players, but had no `Partisan menu` command-menu logs at all when `I` was pressed. The command menu, request bridge, and loadout editor now resolve local ownership through `GetGame().GetPlayerController()`, the component attached to that local controller, the native local player id, and finally the locally controlled entity. Physical-war active vehicles now receive explicit faction stamping, and active groups are reconciled during runtime survivor updates so spawned agents, direct fallback members, convoy vehicles, and active vehicles are corrected or reported with mismatch evidence. Convoy debug probes now force one immediate convoy runtime service pass before physical assertions, and convoy completion no longer treats missing/pending crew runtime as eliminated. Captive follow now detects repeated no-progress while outside the close-follow distance and refreshes through a static waypoint fallback when the direct/entity-follow path stalls. Mission marker backing checks now accept any visible marker linked to the mission instance, because the map marker service intentionally suppresses a generic mission marker when an objective or asset marker is already published. These changes still need a fresh Workbench/dedicated server-client run.
- Current admin-ID follow-up: the July 5 dedicated server log showed the SteamID64 for `h` as `76561198196962295`. `membership.adminIdentityIds` now only accepts raw 17-digit SteamID64 values and no longer treats the backend UUID `518d3fb7-2613-40b5-bf21-cb206ede7684`, `workbench_player_N`, prefixed aliases, or session player ids as settings-admin tokens; the old `workbench_player_1` debug fallback admin grant is removed. Runtime matching is intended to prove the SteamID64 through `BackendApi.GetPlayerPlatformId(playerId)` and log the exact grant reason as `Partisan admin | granted runtime admin ... via settings SteamID64 ...`; campaign-debug bootstrap also records the actor backend UUID, SteamID64, and grant reason with WARN status if authority was not proven through SteamID64 settings. This is static-validated only and needs a fresh dedicated server/client run.
- Current convoy asset-plan follow-up: convoy mission initialization now keeps failed vehicle planning as an unspawned convoy instead of setting generic runtime fallback, and the start planner falls through from random 2000-5000m probes to generated-route anchors and then generated-route segment samples while still enforcing road resolution, staging clearance, distance band, vehicle footprint, and full-column slot checks. Mission-sweep runtime assertions now require the full planned convoy vehicle count, not just one convoy asset. This is static-validated only and needs a fresh runtime run.
- Current support population proof follow-up: the last full JSON report still had `support.physical_population` failures because support physicalization created the active-group record, but the campaign-debug probe checked population before forcing physical-war runtime entity creation. The support probe now runs `HST_PhysicalWarService.UpdateRoutedActiveGroupsNow()` immediately after physicalization, records spawn-probe metrics, then resolves any `spawn_pending_agents` group through the debug population fallback before judging support route movement. This is static-validated only and needs a fresh runtime run.
- Current mission-cleanup strictness follow-up: the last full JSON report had many WARN rows where mission-owned active groups remained live after cleanup. Debug-prefixed mission cleanup now removes mission-owned active-group records and their runtime group entities before counting linked/live groups, and records removal counts as cleanup metrics. This is static-validated only and needs a fresh runtime run.
- Latest 12:29 admin/menu follow-up: the dedicated server/client run loaded a pretty-printed `HST_Settings.json` where `membership.adminIdentityIds` spanned multiple lines. The settings parser only handled one-line arrays, so the configured SteamID64 was silently lost before admin matching. The same client log showed the command menu component ready with custom binding active, setup closing cleanly, and the command menu rendering from Petros/contextual open, but no custom `HST_CommandMenu`, raw `KC_I`, or native `PlayerMenuInvite` input edge. Current code parses multi-line settings arrays, logs parsed admin count and one-shot SteamID64 mismatch diagnostics, activates/listens/polls native `PlayerMenuInvite` from `PlayerMenuContext` as an `I` fallback, and labels Petros/contextual opens explicitly. This is static-validated only until the next dedicated server/client run proves `settings SteamID64` admin grant and `native PlayerMenuInvite` or custom/raw `I` menu-open logs.
- Latest 13:37 admin/menu/teleport follow-up: the latest available server/client logs proved the HST path did grant admin via `settings SteamID64 76561198196962295`, accepted `admin_run_campaign_debug full`, received native `PlayerMenuInvite` input, and opened the command menu via native `I`. The same evidence does not prove that campaign-debug teleports were visible on the owning client because HST only confirmed the server-side controlled entity. Current code now sends each campaign-debug teleport through the player-owned request bridge as an owner RPC, logs `owner RPC 1` in the server campaign-debug teleport line, and logs `Partisan campaign debug teleport owner ... confirmed 1` on the client when the owning view moves. This is static-validated only until the next dedicated server/client run proves the new owner-side teleport line.
- Latest 14:32 runtime follow-up: the newest server/client logs again proved `settings SteamID64 76561198196962295` admin grant and native `I` menu opening, but also showed Petros respawning every HQ lifecycle tick after a successful AIGroup attach and direct fallback active groups reporting live agents before survivor updates collapsed them to zero/eliminated. Current code treats the prepared Petros character handle as the HQ runtime proof instead of requiring the optional AIGroup link, spawns direct-fallback replacement groups with `SCR_AIGroup.IgnoreSpawning(true)` before adding verified faction infantry, refreshes populated active groups' `m_iSpawnedAtSecond`, activates the replacement group after direct members are attached, and gives newly populated active groups a short live-count grace before survivor elimination. This is static-validated only until the next dedicated server/client run proves Petros no longer respawns each tick and fallback groups remain countable past their initial population tick.
- Latest Petros initialization follow-up: the July 5 23:42 server log showed Petros spawned and attached, then was treated as removed/dead on the next HQ tick, leaving `m_bHQRuntimeObjectsSpawned=false` in the generated save. Current code now treats a `ChimeraCharacter` with no `CharacterControllerComponent` yet as an initializing live candidate unless damage state proves destruction, so HQ liveness falls through to damage/entity proof instead of deleting Petros during initialization. Tracked Petros refresh also re-runs preparation so stationary controls are applied when the delayed controller appears. This is static-validated only until a fresh dedicated server/client run proves the r8 build line and a stable Petros spawn count.
- Latest convoy post-completion proof follow-up: reward application already required state-backed live-crew history, but mission-runtime post-completion interactions and command UI follow-up actions could still trust convoy completion event tokens alone. Current code now passes campaign state into those helpers and preserves/reopens convoy payload, captive, and vehicle interactions only when the guarded crew-eliminated outcome is applied or matching `mission_convoy_` groups are eliminated with live-crew history. This is static-validated only until a fresh dedicated server/client run proves the r9 build line and convoy post-completion rows.
- Latest runtime faction audit follow-up: the July 5 full debug JSON showed `physical_combat.*_runtime_faction` failing with `mismatches 0` but `live members 0`, while the same case's population evidence proved direct fallback created four living members per side before combat killed both groups. Current code now counts unique living direct fallback member entities alongside native `AIGroup` agents for faction/live-member proof, checks direct member faction components even when a group root is also tracked, and lets the physical-combat faction assertion use live-member evidence observed during the sample window instead of requiring survivors at the final result tick. This is static-validated only until a fresh dedicated server/client run proves the r10 build line and removes the stale runtime-faction BLOCKED rows.

Historical checkpoint runtime result (superseded by Current Runtime Evidence):

- Full profile completed and wrote campaign-debug artifacts. Final counts were `PASS 374`, `WARN 168`, `FAIL 42`, `BLOCKED 7`, `SKIPPED 0`.
- Script validation/startup stayed clean for this checkpoint; the only script warnings found were stock obsolete backend callback warnings from base-game ban command scripts.
- The checkpoint exposed real red cases that should not be hidden: support route movement stalls, invalid generated-site anchors, convoy driver seating, persistence summary mismatch, captive/primitive/logistics runtime probes, Phase 17/20/21/22 state failures, Phase 23 marker assertions, and cleanup leak warnings.
- The physical loadout reflection failed in the 12:47 run because the real saved-loadout apply returned `Inventory Full` on a controlled player with no cargo-capable storage. The current code treats that as a blocked probe precondition instead of a hard loadout failure, but this specific change still needs a fresh Workbench/runtime run before the audit can count it as closed by runtime evidence.

Unproven or incomplete against the pasted contract:

- Natural physical behavior is still incomplete for support contact/combat, player-driven transport over real routes, POW transport over a real route, natural hostile area-clearing combat inside real mission flow, natural live convoy staging-to-terminal phase history under physical movement, counterattack/Defend Petros multi-wave contact/arrival/resolution, and extended autonomous background-war soak. The standalone `physical_combat.ai_contact` probe now covers opposing AI spawn/contact/casualty observation, but it does not replace primitive-specific combat behavior.
- Loadout apply now proves the real command path, native serialized self-loadout apply, finite arsenal withdrawal, issued-ledger creation, invalid apply no-mutation, non-serialized physical item insertion into player inventory when the live inventory has cargo capacity, server-side live-draft slot model reflection/restoration, serialized restore, and cleanup restoration. The capacity-preflight fix is static-validated but still needs a fresh runtime pass. Direct rendered UI inspection and exact visual equipment-slot inspection remain unproven.
- Render/UI proof now has a static-validated owner-client command-menu render probe wired into Campaign Debug, but it still needs a fresh dedicated server/client run before it counts as runtime evidence. Rendered map widget inspection is not automated.
- Persistence proof is still in-process/seeded for the one-button runner; real process restart, multiclient reconnect/soak, and physical field-vehicle respawn after process restore remain external/manual.
- The latest debug-only/runtime code slice has passed static validation, and the referenced log folder includes a later Workbench script reload proving the enemy-order probe context-field repair no longer causes the earlier missing-field compile error. This audit still does not include a fresh Workbench or dedicated server/client runtime run after the captive-follow entity waypoint, dedicated-server AIGroup direct-infantry fallback, runtime group/vehicle faction stamping, setup-phase service tick guard, loadout Escape pause-menu guard, loadout physical capacity preflight, Phase 23 marker-position assertion, campaign-debug liveness guard, vehicle source-metadata restore, generated-content road/site fallback relaxations, Phase 17 conquest-gated target selection and async group-pending classification, Phase 21 undercover fixture reset, AIGroup population-grace, convoy crew seating-grace, command-menu `I` input consume/logging, Phase 22 report/success assertion tolerance, and typed early-mechanics duplicate-wrapper fixes.

## Behavior Safety

- Admin-only is not state-safe. The current full profile can drive campaign-end
  evaluation, spend resources, create durable runtime records, and trigger
  autosaves. Treat it as destructive until isolation and restoration are proven.
- Recent runner changes are debug-only/admin-only unless noted otherwise: typed result cases, action/observation wrappers, phase-smoke persistence cases, marker/native-marker assertions, reports, artifacts, cleanup probes, and audit text only run from campaign debug/admin commands.
- Normal gameplay ownership changes are now explicitly routed through the
  Schema-62 service. Political support can change a town in either direction,
  and its exact request can wait as a durable pre-owner receipt behind an earlier
  publisher. No runtime result yet proves its retry, security, nested-publication,
  or save/restart behavior. Treat the source contract as intended gameplay and
  the balance/native consequences as unverified until the packaged matrix passes.
- The audit does not count a case as fully implemented just because a debug command returns text. Physical behavior remains open until the runner observes world state, movement/progression, cleanup, and failure evidence.

## Coverage Progress Matrix

| Area | Closed Evidence | Remaining Gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Typed harness and artifacts | Typed run/case/assertion/metric data, run IDs, JSON/summary/state-diff artifacts, status/cancel/cleanup commands, action/observation typed wrappers, and explicit typed completion/receipt mapping for support recall. | Generic action/observation rows and unmigrated visible commands are still classifier-backed evidence, not feature-specific physical probes. |
| Phase smoke wrapping | Valid phase-smoke indexes 0-62 now emit typed cases instead of duplicate legacy result rows; phase persistence seed/run/report steps are typed. | Physical depth inside some phases remains partial. |
| Bootstrap/preflight/HQ | Server/admin/member/commander, phase repair, HQ/Petros/player presence, service/registry/prefab/zone graph checks, HQ runtime and duplicate scans. | Command-menu visual opening remains inferred through service/menu data, not rendered UI. |
| Economy/recruitment/support/civilians/undercover | Exact resource/income/training deltas, garrison recruit/remove, support records/ETA/markers/QRF/search route-state samples, typed recall receipt and paired-settlement conflict cases, eight coordinator-integrated schema-49 operation assertions, plus civilian/undercover probes. | Operation assertions still need packaged execution; production RPC/save-restart recall replay, real-frame support movement, two-sample arrival/recall exit, unconditional terminal resolution, natural support contact/combat, and broader civilian reaction behavior remain unproven. |
| Blueprint Phase 8 ambient runtime | The sealed Settings-24 source/Workbench checkpoint and pure proof kernels cover global actor/traffic caps, 120-second-or-longer fair leases, deterministic rotation, four-root transaction-start scheduling, asynchronous readiness state, immutable per-zone/kind slots, bounded slot-specific recovery/recycle decisions, static military owner/policy refresh, settings migration, session-only topology, save/cargo filtering, field-vehicle promotion, and legacy detached-claim migration. Production observes claims player-first every server frame without a full ambient-root occupancy scan. Every `HST_PersistenceService` capture/checkpoint path plus new-campaign reset repeats reconciliation. One tracker registers promoted/restored/adopted/garage roots for current transform/destruction/cargo position, resolves exact registered bindings first, permits a unique same-prefab root within 8 meters only for initial/recovery binding, and fails closed on ambiguity. Reset can retain occupied live tracked `loot_vehicle`, `field_vehicle`, and `garage_redeploy` roots, normalizes them to `field_vehicle`, and copies retained vehicle/cargo before replacing state. Campaign Debug Phase 20 consumes the production global plan/four-root transaction-start cap. Foundation passes at 711 references; stamped-tree normal and all-five Workbench checks pass at 5,799 files/11,718 classes with CRC `bb083672`, zero HST script errors, and zero surviving processes. The exact sealed identity is implementation `6afadc7c13681b78171939a740862e52328beffd`, UTC `2026-07-12T15:57:55Z`, and label `schema64-settings24-ambient-runtime-authority`. | Campaign Debug has not run. Package-prove exact CIV group/faction membership and waypoint activity; exact pilot seating, engine start, route activation, movement, recovery, recycle, and teardown; daytime/heat/population/budget demand; owner refresh; native brief enter/exit; autosave/restart; promoted-root destruction; new-campaign reset; two nearby same-prefab durable rows restore to two distinct physical roots without collapse; Campaign Debug Phase 20 production-path behavior; and ten towns for ten minutes without allocation churn or the one-second stutter. Schema-65 consequences and sealed Schema-66 exact local security are source-implemented but still require native/package/restart/soak proof. Aid and ownership/security-pressure paths also need runtime proof. |
| Schema-65 civilian consequences | Sealed source/Workbench adds bounded 256-casualty/64-theft queues with a combined four-attempt frame cap, bounded-backoff indefinite retry and capture deferral; exact-pilot resistance theft after durable promotion while passenger-only roots remain non-recyclable; episode combat that rejects `HOT`-only inference and drains pending receipts before a new edge; adopted-floor/last-applied invariants and full canonical `+4`-heat/zero-other-effect restore fingerprints; exact town aggression/strategic evidence; and RUN/calm-WALK panic with separate bounded route recovery and no hot-path AI activation. Minor localities remain panic-only. Foundation passes at 717 script-symbol references. Final stamped normal/all-five Workbench checks are clean at 5,802 Game files/11,728 classes with CRC `c0a672b9`, `Script validation successful`, zero HST errors, and zero surviving processes. | Every runtime gate remains open. Execute every deterministic fixture, then package-prove callback attribution/fallback deduplication, queue capacity/capture deferral, pilot-only claim with passenger protection, at-most-once population/aggression, clear/rebound episodes, native threat/speed/waypoint behavior, pre-65 migration, indexed structural validation plus preset-role quarantine, process restart, multiplayer, and soak. Minor-locality exact fingerprints are session-only, so their cross-process replay/conflict guarantee remains open. |
| Schema-66 exact local security | Sealed source/Workbench adds one deterministic exact enemy-town patrol epoch with an authored 2–5 member frozen roster, held SpawnQueue slots, exact physical/virtual transfer, casualty-preserving fold/restore, compact terminal authority, once-only police `-1` destruction consequence, same-epoch no-resurrection, and rearm only from newer ownership or later positive police pressure. Resistance automatic police/roadblock targets are zero. Pre-66 migration preserves logical facts and removes only unlinked legacy projections; current malformed graphs quarantine at `-66`. Foundation passes at 729 references; final normal/all-five Workbench checks pass at 5,806 files/11,740 classes with CRC `ec860be7`. | The wired Campaign Debug proof has not executed. Package-prove native group/waypoint readiness, live casualties, bubble fold/re-entry, no refill, save/restart, destruction replay, no-loss settlement, rearm, ownership sequencing, campaign stop/setup, migration/quarantine, multiplayer, and soak. |
| Schema-67 enemy strategic resource authority | Sealed source makes each versioned pool the per-enemy balance/cadence/checkpoint owner. Compact periodic evidence is separate from an un-compacted contiguous operational sequence, including zero-effect rows, capped at 4,096 per faction. One API owns live mutations; restore validates order/ledger/town/ownership backlinks. | Sealed identity is `2798cb20b824ed74419ab6dc9bdce03f18ef71df`, UTC `2026-07-12T23:46:02Z`, label `schema67-settings24-enemy-strategic-resource-authority`; Foundation passes at 736 references. Final normal/all-five Workbench checks pass at 5,809/11,751 with CRC `a353fa0d`, successful WORKBENCH/PC/XBOX/PS4/PS5 validation, zero HST script errors, and zero surviving processes. Campaign Debug remains unexecuted. Core adoption/replay/arithmetic/cadence/separation/war/cap/roundtrip/quarantine assertions and exact QRF/patrol mutation-ID assertions are wired/static. Execute them, then real-restart the full reciprocal graph and hard-stop without duplicate debit/refund. Schema-68 planning consumes but does not replace this sealed authority. |
| Schema-68 enemy planning plus sealed bootstrap and commitment awareness | The sealed planner keeps one independent 180-second row per configured enemy and exact frozen decision/backlink authority. The bootstrap seal uses one production fresh-state factory, exact-recovers only the known preset-bound three-pool/two-planner/non-null/empty-ledger `-67`/`-68` signature at the current second, rejects near misses, throttles unchanged warnings, and exposes production exact resolvers. Commitment-aware planning collapses linked response rows with blocking precedence, rejects incompatible targets before ranking, penalizes compatible roots, deterministically reranks duplicate-patrol choices, makes preparation freeze-only, revalidates before pressure/debit including pressure-marked retries, and turns all-target exhaustion into a zero-cost skip. | Active engine-proof identity `4c9a94a1cb4811b6e75a7dca5dba70efffcb523d`, UTC `2026-07-13T15:43:01Z`, label `schema68-settings24-enemy-planning-engine-proof`; Foundation 753; final all-target Workbench log `logs_2026-07-13_11-43-49`, 5,816/11,770, CRC `5a998c21`, successful WORKBENCH/PC/XBOX/PS4/PS5 validation, successful exit, and zero surviving processes. Focused engine log `logs_2026-07-13_11-44-28` produced JUnit at `2026-07-13T15:44:34.667Z`: one testcase, no failure, empty failed list, and `AllExact=true` for all 17 fixtures including retry-quarantine repeated-pass idempotency. Full Campaign Debug in `HST_Dev`, coordinator isolation/artifacts, live authority, fresh package, affected-save restart, dedicated/live-server, multiplayer/network, and soak remain open. |
| Schema-69 exact enemy counterattack | Newly admitted contract-`1` counterattacks use one frozen infantry aggregate, one charged pool, direct virtual travel, deterministic combat, casualty-preserving physical/virtual handoff, canonical ownership, return, and survivor-proportional settlement. Appended `PREPARED` terminal intent enforces prepare -> stage -> refund -> record -> finalize and resumes on restore or a same-session tick. Explicit and deterministically derived claimant IDs reject duplicate or foreign cleanup authority; historical rows remain contract `0`, and invalid current graphs quarantine at `-69`. | The scoped checkpoint is sealed at implementation `5bdcda938840ab769b41ff3e1856d908572a8c45`, stamp commit `73a64ef`, Foundation 771, all-target Workbench log `logs_2026-07-13_15-41-50` at CRC `3a8bd64f`, and focused log `logs_2026-07-13_15-42-52` with one passing JUnit testcase, empty failed list, and `AllExact=1`. Valid PREPARED recovery, same-session ABORTED recovery, foreign derived-ID collision hold, and SETTLED-without-receipt fail-closed proof pass. The environment records a recoverable base-game VM exception before successful HST completion. Full Campaign Debug Phase 17, serialization/restart, package/native/live-server behavior, migration and marker runtime, multiplayer/network/JIP/reconnect, and soak remain open. |
| Schema-70 exact enemy garrison rebuild | Newly admitted contract-`1` rebuilds preflight one capacity-bounded frozen infantry roster and source/target ownership capability before one 10-support debit, then build one reciprocal order/operation/manifest/batch/group graph or roll back exactly. Casualties persist across virtual/physical transfer. Delivery links survivors as held garrison authority under an `OPEN`/`ON_STATION` operation with a zero-delta receipt and no aggregate double count; later terminal retirement refunds zero. Historical rows remain contract `0`, while malformed/orphan current authority quarantines at `-70` with claimant-wide process holds and retention pins. | The scoped checkpoint is sealed at implementation `2f71236bfc02329a3c8000b104f1b7b1043dc99c`, UTC `2026-07-13T22:20:52Z`, stamp commit `ef95555`, and Foundation 790. Final post-integration Workbench log `logs_2026-07-13_20-50-56` completes compile/create at Game CRC `fd9e2cf4` with a clean exit and zero surviving processes; focused log `logs_2026-07-13_20-51-20` has one JUnit testcase, zero failures, `AllExact=1`, all 13 headline flags at `1`, and zero surviving processes. The known recoverable `GetPlayerIdentityId` VM exception plus two `SCR_FilterCategory` non-public-constructor diagnostics during harness setup mean the focused environment is successful but not exception-free. Full Campaign Debug remains unrun, including `early_mechanics.force_authority` and the Phase 18 `enemy_commander` live rebuild smoke. Serialization/restart, package/native/live-server behavior, migration and marker runtime, multiplayer/network/JIP/reconnect, and soak remain open. |
| Provisional Partisan profile-tree migration | `$profile:Partisan` is the only generated-data root. Before consumers run, arbitrary nested retired files use verified staging, destination recheck, canonical or file/directory conflict archival, final byte comparison, and only then source deletion. Directories delete deepest first; completion requires the retired root to be absent. Same-process calls are guarded and supported startup is single-writer because cross-process atomic promotion/locking is unavailable. | Foundation/all-target Workbench pass. Latest package proved canonical generation only and had no retired tree. Packaged nested-file, identical/different-conflict, directory-conflict, empty-directory/root-removal, semantic settings/save migration, and restart proof remain open. |
| Ownership transition | Schema-62 source fixtures exercise all cause routes, FIFO/pristine restore, replay/conflict/stale handling, interrupted restore, staged full-marker rollback, resolver fail-close/unsafe-row purge, setup history, exact correlations, persistence re-arm, nested release, restart, security, migration, and retention. Schema 64 routes strict political threshold intent through this same transaction; Schema 66 preflights and retires exact local-security authority before owner publication. | Execute the proof, then package-test local-security casualty reconciliation/non-loss retirement, zero resistance police/roadblocks, queued political intent, exact consequences, real persistence resume, rendered marker/menu/GM/notification coherence, multiplayer/reconnect/JIP, and all callers. No town support, legacy projection, or generic security cleanup may bypass these owners. |
| Combat presence and zone heat | Sealed Schema-63 source wires one shared cached service into capture, missions, HQ, civilians, and enemy strategy; its state-only proof covers empty vehicles, authoritative count separation, rejected stale/terminal/quarantined rows, exact heat timing/rebound and pre-cooling HOT guard, pre-63 cold migration, bounded valid cooling restore, malformed-current fail-cold, physical-sample invalidation, and deterministic bounded diagnostics. Foundation passes at 681 references; normal Workbench open compiled/created 5,788 files/11,670 classes at CRC `a40056c5` without HST script errors or a crash, and explicit validation passes for all five configurations. | The assertions have not run. Native runtime must prove conscious/unconscious, dismounted/cargo/pilot/turret, armed/unarmed, mobile/static, destroyed/burning/immobile, registered/stale classification; fail-closed authority gaps and strict player filtering; allocation/cache invalidation/order; virtual casualties; all consumers; exact 30-second cooling; real save/restart; and no save-dirty or stutter regression. |
| Town influence and political Map/War | The preceding sealed Schema-64/settings-23 source checkpoint wires one canonical town service, save validator, and pure Map/War projection. The sealed Schema-65 delta extends exact event identity with aggression target/delta/before/after evidence. Sealed Schema 67 requires the matching aggression mutation to enter the canonical per-enemy mutation authority rather than a direct pool write. | Execute the existing fixtures plus Schema-67 town-event-to-aggression receipt replay/conflict/restart cases. Prove pre-64/pre-65/pre-67 migration order, `-64`/`-65`/`-67` quarantine, separate occupier/invader state, stable-ID exhaustion, every caller, no owner bypass, real serialization/restart, rendered rows, due-expiry cost, and no stutter. |
| Active-group lifecycle | Deterministic `active_group_lifecycle.*` cases prove one mixed-QRF personnel-terminal transition, linked QRF failure, zero capture pressure, terminal-before-unresolved marker ordering, replay no-op, schema-48 roundtrip, and living-mixed/vehicle-only controls. | Physical neutral-salvage detachment, entity/handle cleanup, player capture, dedicated replication, ownership-flip behavior, and process restart remain external runtime gaps. |
| Physical AI combat | Timed `physical_combat.ai_contact` probe spawns temporary resistance/enemy active groups in the player render bubble, proves native faction hostility, assigns opposing search-and-destroy waypoints, samples live counts/distance through the normal physical-war tick, requires live-count loss during the hostile-contact window, and cleans all temporary groups/waypoints. | This does not yet prove support-arrival combat, primitive area-clearing combat, or multi-wave Petros/counterattack resolution. |
| Missions and primitives | All-mission start/runtime/cleanup cases, primitive-specific probes for kill/destroy/recover/deliver/rescue/hold/clear, exact reward assertions, mission cleanup checks, and explicit admin-cleanup WARN classification. | Natural player driving/path travel, mission-owned hostile combat/area clearing, and true runtime completion for every mission remain partial. |
| Garage/loadout | Real garage store/redeploy/capture/cargo restoration plus loadout open/close session checks, valid saved-loadout apply through the real command path, finite arsenal withdrawal, issued-ledger creation, invalid apply no-mutation, non-serialized physical inventory insertion, server-side live-draft slot model reflection/restoration, serialized restore, and restoration of transient debug state. | Direct rendered/editor UI interaction and exact visual equipment-slot inspection for the seeded finite loadout item remain open. |
| Convoys | Asset/entity/crew/driver/mobile/route/waypoint/readiness/progress/stall/recovery/contact evidence with no-progress failures, sampled travel/contact-or-terminal/terminal phase-chain assertions, plus a separate controlled state-machine probe that proves staging -> moving -> contact -> eliminated on temporary debug records through the real physical-war helpers. | Natural live staging -> moving -> contact -> arrival/elimination phase history is still WARN unless every phase is actually observed for the convoy under test; the controlled probe does not prove physical driving or the arrival failure path. |
| POW/captives | Free/follow/extract state, repeated follow samples, alive/extracted counts, exact reward deltas, and a debug-only temporary captive boarding/transport compartment probe. | Natural player-driven POW transport over a real route remains open. |
| Phase 17/22 enemy response | Counterattack/Petros attack orders, support physicalization, linked active groups, routed movement samples, stall evidence, and Phase 22 base-position assertions proving Defend Petros targets HQ/Petros rather than the nearby bookkeeping zone. | Multi-wave/contact/arrival/resolution behavior remains open. |
| Markers/UI/native markers | Prior command/model/native-handle assertions plus the Schema-61 stream and Schema-62 protocol-2 source revision. The Schema-66 repair protects system markers. The owner-client probe mutates and deletes a tracked campaign marker, runs and retries final production repair, proves canonical system ownership/non-removability, stable registry/static count, exactly one instance, and isolated player-marker edit/removal/cleanup. | The probe compiles in current Workbench validation but has not executed. Run it, then republish and attempt campaign-marker delete/move/edit on host/client; prove bounded self-heal, player-marker isolation, host/two-client equality, atomicity, no duplicate set, map reopen, reconnect/late join, and cleanup. |
| Background war/escalation/campaign end | Controlled commander tick, POI target assertions, resource spending, low/mid/high pressure windows, short repeated background-war commander/resource cycle, aggression decay, forced victory/loss terminal snapshots. | Extended autonomous occupier-vs-invader soak and heavier support eligibility across varied POIs remain open. |
| Render bubbles | One clean zone far/near/leave activation and cleanup timeout through physical-war update, expired player-bound mission asset near/far/player-carrier bubble policy assertions, and expired convoy contact near/far preserve/delete cleanup policy assertions. Sealed Schema 63 uses activation radius for entry and the larger deactivation radius for exit. | The existing runtime artifact predates that hysteresis. Re-execute boundary crossings, rendered inspection, stutter profiling, and multiple zone-type windows. |
| Persistence | Baseline typed persistence and seeded smoke roundtrip exist. Sealed Schema 67 deep-copies strategic authority, while the sealed Schema-68 startup correction distinguishes a complete fresh fallback from restored corruption and exact-recovers only the observed generated quarantine. Whole-tree profile movement precedes settings/save consumers and is byte-verified before removal. | Execute all proof sets and real process restart: fresh executable authority, affected-save exact recovery, near-miss quarantine, no duplicate mutation, cadence/backlink continuity, verified retired-tree removal/conflict archival, semantic settings/save migration, and all existing local-security/event/vehicle/reconnect/soak gates. |
| Cleanup/stalls | Prefixed persisted cleanup, tagged world cleanup, post-case leak probes, stall evidence for several physical categories. | Arbitrary untagged leftovers cannot be removed; stall evidence is not yet uniform for every physical category. |

## Implemented Evidence

- Admin command wiring exists for start/status/cancel/cleanup in `Scripts/Game/HST/Services/HST_CommandUIService.c`.
- The coordinator exposes `RequestAdminRunCampaignDebug`, `RequestAdminCampaignDebugStatus`, `RequestAdminCancelCampaignDebug`, and `RequestAdminCleanupCampaignDebug`.
- The runner remains sequenced through bootstrap, baseline, HQ, economy/support, early mechanics, mission sweep, phase smoke, final report, and completion.
- Run profiles are accepted as `smoke`, `physical`, and `full`: `smoke` skips the long early/mission/phase sweeps, `physical` keeps early mechanics plus the mission/physical sweep and skips late phase smoke, and `full` preserves the complete sequence.
- Typed result classes exist in `Scripts/Game/HST/Data/HST_CampaignDebugResult.c`.
- Artifacts write to `$profile:Partisan/debug` as JSON, summary text, and state-diff text. Whole-tree startup migration byte-verifies earlier debug artifacts at the same relative path or conflict archive before removing their retired copies.
- Runs now record a deterministic debug marker prefix, mission prefix, and entity tag in JSON, summary, state-diff, and status output.
- Run start removes stale `hst_debug_`-prefixed persisted state before capturing start counts. Forced debug-started missions are retagged before objective/runtime initialization so derived objective/runtime/asset/group/marker records inherit the run prefix.
- Debug-created player support and compatibility contract-`0` enemy-order smoke
  rows may be retagged with the current run prefix before marker refresh/report
  output. A nonzero exact enemy order keeps its admission ID because reciprocal
  operation, manifest, batch, group, debit, and receipt identities derive from
  it. Phase 17 Schema-69 counterattacks and Phase 18 Schema-70 rebuilds are
  tracked and cleaned by those stable IDs; support request cases may still assert
  their debug prefix directly.
- Generic command/action outputs now record typed `action.*` cases, and read-only report snapshots now record typed `observation.*` cases instead of legacy string rows. Observation coverage includes baseline foundation/campaign/balance/end/marker/zone-composition reports, HQ threat/arsenal/loadout reports, Stage 3 recruitment/support/civilian/town/undercover reports, report-step snapshots from the early sweep, completion summaries, and the final consolidated report.
- Bootstrap records typed assertions for server authority, debug actor access, active campaign repair, HQ state, Petros state, teleport, player presence, and spawn summary evidence.
- Preflight records typed assertions for key services, mission registry count/uniqueness/runtime/duration, compatible debug target zones, default faction/civilian prefab resource resolution, runtime-selected mission prop/vehicle prefab resolution, runtime waypoint prefab resolution, zone graph counts, and physical-war setting. Baseline persistence now records typed service/report/health/mode assertions and reports native-unavailable/profile-fallback operation as WARN instead of a legacy string row.
- HQ runtime records typed assertions for runtime flag, tracked Petros/cache/arsenal/tent/spawn-point entity count, Petros/cache/arsenal/tent/spawn-point runtime entity keys and positions, per-slot nearby world duplicate scans, arsenal usability, HQ marker, active admin command-menu campaign-debug controls, command coverage, and player position.
- Economy records typed exact-delta assertions for resource awards, forced income ticks, and training. The income case seeds a resistance-owned income zone, calculates expected money/HR through the town service, asserts exact money/HR deltas, records enemy-owned income potential as excluded, and checks that the force-income command does not unexpectedly mutate the passive timer.
- Stage 3 support requests now clear prior player support, call the real support command, assert the created support request record type, faction, target zone/position, ETA, money cost, status, marker publication/pending state, controlled ETA progression, QRF/search ground-support physicalization into linked active groups, and repeated campaign-clock route-state samples with movement/distance-closure/stall evidence. The synchronous probe now hard-fails only if ETA invents arrival while the group remains outside 75m; movement, stall timeout, and actual arrival remain WARN/non-certifying until sampled over real elapsed time. Terminal injection/resolution runs only after prior live arrival, so its assertion otherwise remains WARN; runtime-group cleanup remains covered.
- Early physical AI combat coverage now records `physical_combat.ai_contact`. It creates temporary resistance/enemy active groups near the controlled player, assigns search-and-destroy waypoints toward the opposing side, samples live counts and group distance through the normal physical-war tick for the configured window, asserts faction split/native hostility/runtime entities/waypoints/sample window/contact distance, records casualty-resolution as PASS or FAIL depending on observed live-count loss, and removes all temporary groups and waypoints before recording cleanup.
- Civilian aid now records typed money/support/heat assertions, exact clamped support/reputation/heat deltas, and hard town/zone bounds. Support cancellation now seeds and cancels a real player support request by ID, captures the immediate cancellation status/resolution, runs cleanup, and asserts no queued/active player support or cooldown remains for follow-on probes.
- Early garrison recruit/remove now records a typed case. It arranges an inactive resistance-owned zone with capacity, calls the real recruit and remove command paths, asserts exact infantry/vehicle deltas, exact money/HR cost, and restores the temporary owner/active/garrison-record state.
- Early foundation/checkpoint now records a typed case. It asserts server/member prerequisites, active campaign schema/HQ/Petros/position state, active mission/group count stability across checkpoint, checkpoint command success, persistence status evidence, last-save timestamp refresh, and captured save snapshot schema/HQ/Petros state.
- Early mission-runtime visibility now records a typed case. It asserts mission/UI/runtime/objective services, mission registry count, active mission summary/runtime/objective report availability, explicit zero-active reporting, active mission identity/runtime metadata, fallback/failure warning evidence, and orphan objective/asset/runtime-entity detection.
- Early garage/vehicle/loadout coverage now records a typed action case. It captures baseline reports, stores a debug-prefixed garage vehicle through the commander path, arranges stored cargo, redeploys through the real build-mode garage command, verifies runtime vehicle and restored vehicle-cargo state, captures the redeployed vehicle back through the member garage path for physical cleanup, opens/closes the loadout editor while asserting server session state and issued-loadout ledger stability, applies a transient valid saved loadout through the real member command with finite arsenal withdrawal and issued-ledger assertions, rejects a transient invalid saved loadout with no partial mutation, applies a transient non-serialized saved loadout and counts physical player-inventory plus server-side live-draft reflection/restoration, and restores the saved-loadout, arsenal, issued-ledger, player inventory, editor-session, garage, runtime vehicle, and cargo state touched by the probe.
- Early command UI coverage now records a typed case instead of only wrapping the Phase 23 report string. It asserts command coverage report generation, zero missing visible/dispatch rows, active admin-menu campaign-debug plus Phase 23 control visibility through the shared UI assertion path, and the current member/admin commander controls: one `Transfer commander` chooser action in the Members tab with no direct per-target transfer rows, plus the Admin tab `Force myself commander` action.
- Members command-menu controls now expose commander transfer as one visible `Transfer commander` action. The action opens a selectable modal populated from payload-provided SteamID64/name choices and dispatches the existing commander-transfer server command with the clicked target identity.
- Disabled Game Master budgets now keep placement caps bypassed while pre-balancing disabled-mode cap/current headroom for managed budget types. The shim also restores headroom before vanilla budget subtraction, records `preSubtractRepairs`, keeps `deficitCorrections` as a last-resort hook, and throttles both `restored disabled-budget headroom before native subtract ...` and `corrected first disabled-budget deficit ...` proof rows.
- Early generated-content coverage now records a typed sites/routes case. It asserts per-zone primary/roadblock/support/secondary anchors, site ID uniqueness, site validity/positions/source metadata, generated site type coverage, route ID uniqueness, road-resolved vehicle-safe routes, waypoint counts, route zone links, endpoint positions, and waypoint metadata.
- Phase 12 persistence smoke now records a typed seeded-state case. It asserts the seed/run/report PASS status, manual checkpoint evidence, expected-summary task, active smoke missions, convoy/primitive smoke matrices, mission assets/runtime entities, garage cargo, a restore-eligible field-vehicle runtime sentinel, support/enemy-order sentinels, civilian/undercover sentinel records, and an in-memory `HST_CampaignSaveData` capture/restore whose restored summary/report/counts match the live state. It explicitly records real process restart/reconnect as WARN, not PASS.
- Early zone activation now records typed render-bubble cases through the real `HST_PhysicalWarService.UpdateZoneActivation()`, mission-runtime expired player-bound asset policy paths, and physical-war expired convoy contact cleanup policy paths. The zone case selects a clean inactive non-mission zone with abstract garrison, proves the zone stays inactive while the player is outside its activation radius, proves near-player activation creates active/spawned groups within garrison budget, samples a repeated leave-cleanup window with hard timeout evidence, and restores the selected zone/garrison state. The mission-asset case creates a temporary expired rescue asset, asserts near-player continuation and interaction eligibility, asserts outside-bubble stop/no eligibility, asserts player-carrier continuation, and cleans temporary mission/asset records. The convoy case creates temporary expired convoy contact groups with temporary runtime crew entities, asserts inside-bubble preservation/marking, asserts outside-bubble deletion, and removes temporary mission/group/runtime records.
- Phase persistence smoke steps 0-2 and Phase 14-24 smoke command output are now log/evidence only because all valid phase-smoke indexes have typed phase cases, so the summary matrices are not inflated by duplicate legacy pass/fail rows for the same phase action. Phase 20/21 report steps are included in typed dispatch.
- Phase persistence smoke steps 0-2 now record typed seed/run/report cases for command/report acceptance, persistence smoke service/state readiness, strict seed PASS status, manual checkpoint evidence for seed/run, expected/current/missing summary shape for the report step, and WARN-only expected/current drift when the later smoke report still has `missing/zero none`.
- Phase 20/21 smoke now records typed town support, support up/down mutation, support formula/bounds/cleanup, support-only ownership flips in both directions, zone marker model reflection/restoration for those flips, physical civilian population count/faction/position/cleanup, pedestrian AI helper coverage, configured civilian traffic driver/route helper coverage, bounded civilian movement samples from spawn positions with timeout evidence, wanted heat, a controlled copied-state heat-decay window through the real civilian tick, eligibility, clear-heat, undercover apply, weapon/vehicle compromise, roadblock/police scan, and clear-heat assertions.
- Phase 18/19 smoke records typed enemy-order/support assertions for order/support
  type, faction/player-requested policy, target validity, resource cost fields,
  open-order resolution, and forced-ETA inbound support evidence. Phase 18
  `enemy_commander` owns the live Schema-70 rebuild smoke: it tracks the admitted
  rebuild by its unchanged stable order ID and inspects reciprocal exact
  contract, resource, operation, manifest, projection, held-roster, virtual-
  outbound, physical-gate, legacy-isolation, and cleanup authority. It also seeds
  a background-war state, runs the normal commander tick threshold, and asserts
  occupier/invader order creation, POI targets, duplicate guards, source/target
  positions, context-appropriate order types, enemy pool spending, and zero
  unexpected Petros attacks so the dynamic Defend Petros chain remains owned by
  Phase 22. These Schema-70 assertions are wired but have not run in Full
  Campaign Debug.
- Phase 14 smoke now records typed arsenal assertions for finite-only loot, threshold unlock behavior at count 2, blocked-prefab rejection, raw visual asset rejection, and final report consistency.
- Phase 15 smoke now records typed garage/source-vehicle assertions for stored vehicle records, debug-run ID prefixing, vehicle-root eligibility, redeploy metadata, cargo preservation, ammo-source metadata, and report source counts.
- Phase 16 smoke now records typed garrison/training assertions for selected recruit-zone readiness, resistance garrison records, infantry deltas, zero-cost money/HR behavior, capacity bounds, and zero-cost training level deltas.
- Phase 17 smoke now records typed capture/counterattack assertions for seeded capturable non-conquest-gated zones, ownership flip, progress reset, starter resistance garrison, stable-ID-tracked exact counterattack orders, order costs/positions/status, marker/report evidence, and the exact Schema-69 contract, operation/manifest/batch/group reciprocity, one-pool debit, outbound route, on-station assignment, marker, and terminal cleanup path. Contract-`0` compatibility rows may retain debug prefixes, but the exact counterattack aggregate is never retagged after admission. The one-button force case also exposes the focused exact planning/admission/travel/combat/handoff/ownership/settlement/restore/resource/ambiguity/quarantine/retention report. These assertions are wired but have not run in Full Campaign Debug; real-frame movement, native combat, ownership completion, settlement, restart, and stall proof remain open.
- Phase 22 smoke now records typed HQ/Defend Petros assertions for seeded HQ knowledge/threat, debug-prefixed Petros attack orders, order/support/group/mission/objective/task target positions at the HQ/Petros base instead of the nearby bookkeeping zone, debug-prefixed dynamic defense mission/objective/task records, active mission markers, linked support request evidence, Petros attack physicalization into a prefixed support request, linked attacker-group runtime spawn, repeated campaign-clock attacker route-state samples with WARN/non-certifying distance-closure/stall evidence, admin-success resolution, Petros kill/runtime-clear behavior, and campaign-debug Petros/HQ recovery. Real-frame movement, multi-wave/contact, and arrival behavior remain WARN/not covered.
- Phase 23 smoke now records typed UI/marker assertions for command coverage detail rows, compact Missions-tab active rows, admin menu campaign-debug/Phase-23 controls, marker model counts, every zone marker model entry, zone marker linked ID/owner/color/style/position matching, HQ/mission/support/QRF marker coverage, marker backing-state consistency, native marker report availability, native eligible/published/skipped/failed/pending counter assertions, tracked static native-handle liveness, native marker purge reporting, player marker report inclusion, and strict failed-action sample assertions. The failed-action sample now snapshots campaign state before/after invalid HQ move, invalid zone mission start, and invalid mission completion, then asserts explicit failure reasons, aggregate rejection, tracked count no-mutation, and wider snapshot equality.
- Phase 24 smoke now records typed campaign pacing/escalation/end assertions for early/mid/late seeded resource profiles, control percent, FIA/enemy zone counts, population and airfield metrics, max enemy pool pressure, controlled low/mid/high enemy resource and commander ticks, a short repeated multi-cycle background-war resource/commander window, monotonic war-level income scaling, debug-prefixed escalation orders/support/groups, exact aggression decay, default population-support victory metadata, default civilian-catastrophe loss metadata, campaign-end population metadata save roundtrips, and post-end terminal inactivity snapshots for elapsed time, runtime records, support, orders, money, HR, and income timer.
- Convoy physical probing asserts vehicle asset counts, spawned vehicle entities, crew groups, alive crew, seated drivers, mobile vehicles, route assignment, waypoint assignment, readiness, progress sample presence, repeated progress sample counts, best movement/distance-closed metrics, sampled travel/contact/terminal phase-chain evidence, final convoy phase, hard-stuck count, recovery attempts, and hard no-progress timeout evidence once sampled movement windows reach the convoy recovery/reissue threshold.
- The controlled convoy phase-chain probe creates temporary debug convoy mission/objective/asset/group records, calls the real physical-war transition helpers for staging, moving, contact, and eliminated crew objective completion, asserts the exact observed sequence plus propagated group/objective state, and removes those temporary records before the result is recorded. This is state-machine coverage only; natural movement remains covered by the physical convoy movement probe.
- The mission sweep now records typed mission start/runtime/cleanup cases plus typed primitive probes for non-convoy runtime missions. Start/runtime cases assert definition metadata, command acceptance, active mission records, target zone/position, linked marker evidence, objective/asset/runtime-entity counts, runtime primitive/type metadata, clean spawned runtime state, and convoy vehicle-asset presence where applicable. `kill_hvt` uses the server asset-destroyed path and asserts HVT state, objective completion, mission success, and exact rewards. `destroy_target` uses the server explosive-damage path and asserts demolition hits/source/damage, target state, objective completion, mission success, and exact rewards. `rescue_extract` reuses the captive free/follow/extraction probe and now records a separate temporary captive boarding/transport probe through the runtime boarding helper. `recover_cargo` and `deliver_supplies` arrange a temporary physical vehicle carrier near pickup, use the real load/deliver interactions, move the carrier to delivery, assert delivered state/objectives/rewards, and clean up the temporary carrier entity/runtime record. `hold_area` and `clear_area` teleport the controlled player into the objective radius, neutralize mission-owned hostile group state for the probe, tick the real mission runtime for hold/clear objective completion, assert world detection/objectives/rewards, and WARN that natural hostile combat was not observed.
- The early Phase 13 primitive sample now records a wrapper-level typed case for `rescue_pows` start, debug-prefix tagging, selected mission runtime report evidence, rescue_extract metadata, objective/asset/runtime-entity counts, and succeeded completion status. The captive physical behavior remains covered by the dedicated rescue/captive case.
- POW/captive probing uses real `mission_captive_extract` and `mission_captive_follow` interactions. It asserts freed/following carrier state, alive captive counts, repeated controlled follow runtime samples after player displacement, max movement/distance-closed metrics, hard FAIL timeout evidence when the captive does not close distance or remain near the player, extraction delivery for all required captives, rescue mission completion, and exact money/HR reward deltas. A separate debug-only boarding probe creates a temporary captive asset and temporary carrier, calls `TryMoveCaptiveIntoVehicle`, asserts compartment/boarding state and loaded carrier state, moves the carrier, then disembarks/deletes the temporary entities and records before recording cleanup status.
- Mission cleanup checks active mission status, unresolved assets, mission-owned groups, linked markers, and the completion path. Missions that already succeeded before cleanup are PASS cleanup evidence, missions completed by the debug cleanup command are WARN-only admin-cleanup evidence, and cleanup failures are FAIL.
- The state-diff artifact snapshots start/end objectives, runtime vehicles, mission assets, active groups, support requests, enemy orders, markers, garage vehicles, arsenal items, civilian zones, and undercover records.
- Admin cleanup and run completion now record typed prefixed-state cleanup cases for missions, objectives, runtime entities, mission assets, active groups, runtime vehicles, garage vehicles, QRFs, support requests, enemy orders, map markers, and campaign tasks, then rebuild campaign markers when marker-backed state changed.
- Final completion now records a typed cleanup leak snapshot for active missions, player support, enemy orders, active groups, markers, current/early debug mission IDs, and remaining `hst_debug_`-prefixed persisted records.
- Non-legacy typed cases now emit a `post_case_cleanup.*` leak probe while the runner is active. The probe allows the mission intentionally under test, preserves pre-existing active mission IDs from the run-start snapshot, and asserts unexpected active missions, orphan mission assets, orphan active groups, orphan linked markers, and backing states missing markers.
- The summary artifact now includes feature, mission, physical AI, and cleanup matrices built from typed case results, plus failure inspection command hints for non-pass cases.

## Not Fully Implemented

- Schema 67 is sealed at the source/Workbench identity recorded above and passes
  Foundation at 736 references. Final normal/all-five Workbench checks pass at
  5,809 Game files/11,751 classes with CRC `a353fa0d`; all-five reports successful
  WORKBENCH, PC, XBOX, PS4, and PS5 validation, zero HST script errors, and zero
  surviving processes. Executed Campaign Debug and real-restart artifacts for the
  enemy strategic resource/mutation authority remain pending.
- Sealed Schema 68 implements persisted per-enemy planning cadence,
  deterministic candidate ordering, and the frozen target/source/order/cost/
  pressure/accounting fingerprint. Foundation and final stamped Workbench checks
  pass for the prior seal. All 17 deterministic Schema-68 planning fixtures now
  return exact results in the focused official engine autotest described above.
  The active bootstrap/recovery/throttle correction passes current Foundation
  and all-five Workbench validation, but Full Campaign Debug coordinator/live-
  authority execution and packaged restart proof remain open.
- The current Schema-68 enemy-planning engine-proof checkpoint is sealed at
  implementation `4c9a94a1cb4811b6e75a7dca5dba70efffcb523d`, UTC
  `2026-07-13T15:43:01Z`, label
  `schema68-settings24-enemy-planning-engine-proof`. Foundation passes at 753
  references. Final stamped-tree all-target Workbench log
  `logs_2026-07-13_11-43-49` validates 5,816 files/11,770 classes at CRC
  `5a998c21` for WORKBENCH, PC, XBOX, PS4, and PS5, exits, and leaves zero Workbench
  processes. Focused official engine autotest
  `HST_TEST_EnemyPlanningCommitmentAuthority` records one testcase, zero
  failures, an empty failed list, and `AllExact=true` across all 17 deterministic
  Schema-68 planning fixtures, including retry-quarantine repeated-pass
  idempotency. Full Campaign Debug in `HST_Dev`, coordinator isolation/artifact
  generation, live authority, packaged campaign, restart, dedicated/live-server,
  multiplayer/network, and soak proof remain open.
- Physical runtime depth is still incomplete for fresh packaged support movement,
  two-sample arrival, live adapter casualty observation, cardinality-checked
  projection/root retirement, physical recall exit, and bounded route-reissue proof; natural
  support contact/combat; broader civilian reaction behavior beyond heat/
  population; natural player transport travel including POW transport over a
  real route; mission-owned hostile area-clearing combat; natural live convoy
  full phase history under physical movement; counterattack/Defend Petros multi-
  wave behavior; and extended autonomous background-war soak behavior. The
  standalone physical AI contact probe adds engine-backed opposing-group
  evidence but is not a substitute for those feature-specific flows.
- Loadout editor rendered/visual proof is still partial: the debug runner now counts physical player-inventory reflection/restore and server-side live-draft slot model reflection/restore for a non-serialized saved loadout, but it does not inspect the rendered editor UI or visually prove the seeded finite debug item is equipped in a specific player slot.
- Render/UI depth is still incomplete for rendered map widget inspection. Command-menu visual opening now has an owner-client rendered widget proof path, but the current audit has not yet seen a fresh runtime artifact with that report.
- The later packaged schema-49 check confirmed that stock HUD and Game Master
  access were restored. The schema-50 marker, dialog, radio, civilian, and
  player strategic-projection follow-ups plus the schema-51 enemy defensive-QRF,
  schema-52 exact mission-convoy, schema-53 exact enemy-patrol, and schema-54
  exact purchased-garrison patrol, schema-55 exact officer-mission guard, and
  schema-56 exact traitor-mission guard, schema-57 exact spec-ops-mission guard,
  schema-58 exact POW-rescue, schema-59 exact radio-site, and schema-60 exact
  Search-and-Destroy/location slices remain without packaged evidence until a
  new package is run.
- Strategic projection is limited to eleven explicit family consumers across nine
  operation types: exact paid player
  QRF, newly confirmed player Search-and-Destroy, newly planned enemy defensive
  QRF, newly started exact mission convoy,
  newly queued exact enemy patrol, and newly issued policy-v2 purchased
  resistance garrison patrol, plus guard infantry for newly started
  `assassinate_officer`, `assassinate_traitor`, and `assassinate_specops`
  missions, plus the exact guard-and-three-captive authority for newly started
  `rescue_pows`, plus one automatic exact enemy-town local-security patrol
  consumer. The HVT remains separate mission authority and is not an
  additional force participant. The convoy is
  a narrow three-vehicle/three-crew exception, not generic
  vehicle/multi-root realization, and it does not yet simulate off-screen
  combat. Live physical contact does not yet own player-operation engagement;
  generalized virtualization, historical patrols/other enemy orders and convoys,
  policy-v1/initial/enemy aggregate and vehicle/multi-root garrisons, historical
  pre-opt-in assassination missions, historical/pre-58 POWs, `rescue_refugees`,
  other rescue and mission variants, other
  supports/missions, packaged execution, and real restart/
  migration/archive
  replay remain open.
- Persistence depth is still incomplete for real process restart, multiclient reconnect/soak, and physical field-vehicle respawn after a process restore.
- Cleanup/stall coverage is not universal: untagged debug leftovers cannot be deterministically removed, cleanup depends on debug spawn paths naming physical entities, and some physical categories still lack stall evidence dumps.
- Some rows are intentionally classifier-backed action/observation evidence rather than feature-specific physical probes; these should be replaced with narrower typed cases when they represent real mechanics rather than reports.

## Latest r11 Petros/Faction Follow-up

- The latest inspected runtime artifacts were still r10 and proved Petros could fail before any command-menu interaction: first-run HQ setup spawned and attached Petros, then the runtime character was removed on the next proof tick and retried repeatedly.
- The post-restart r10 artifact proved a separate debug-rebuild bug: the HQ rebuild command cleared Petros, but the Petros respawn debounce still blocked the replacement in the same short debug window.
- r11 changes reset Petros respawn state on explicit HQ runtime clears, configure the manually-owned Petros group as a non-spawning/non-empty-deleting container, and activate both the group and attached Petros agent after attachment. The next runtime artifact must prove `hq.runtime_objects_existing` and `hq.rebuild_command` both retain Petros.
- r10 also proved faction-key repair was too shallow for fallback/direct active-group members. r11 now repairs every tracked runtime entity for the active group and records direct infantry prefab/faction visual evidence. The next runtime artifact must prove cleanup faction mismatches are gone or report exact prefab-level evidence for any remaining mismatch.

## Validation Run

Schema-60 Maiden's Bay taxonomy follow-up is source-implemented but not yet
packaged/runtime-certified. Fresh campaigns now contain one
`resource_logistics_warehouse` at the mapped warehouse position and no
`town_maidens_bay` zone, town marker, or town anchor. Restore cleanup keeps an
existing canonical warehouse authoritative, removes the duplicate town's
civilian/influence/marker rows and aggregate garrison manpower without fold-back
credit, and canonicalizes mutable generic references and ledgers. If neither row
exists, the normalizer makes no change. Multiple canonical rows, or multiple
legacy rows without one canonical authority, fail closed before rewrites and add
only one conflict audit. Nonzero typed claimants stay frozen even when settled,
quarantined, malformed, partially linked, or recognizable only by exact group
mode/status. Mutable sites/routes rekey; typed frozen sites/routes remain
byte-stable and receive deep canonical clones, including all waypoint fields.
Exact garrison-manifest backlinks may retain a zero-manpower compatibility shell.
Ordinary lookup resolves the canonical warehouse; exact historical lookup may
return a detached old-ID/old-position view, and runtime boundaries treat the old
and canonical IDs as equivalent without enumerating another zone.

`HST_MaidensBayLocationMigrationProofService` is compiled and wired into the
force-integrity Campaign Debug case as
`location_taxonomy.maidens_bay_schema60`. Its in-memory both-row/old-only,
generic-reference, frozen-graph, ledger/generated-content, idempotency, and
lookup fixtures have not been executed by Campaign Debug in this checkpoint.
They are therefore not a PASS result and do not prove serialization or process
restart. The next published test must prove only the Logistics Warehouse marker
appears and that a pre-update save/restart does not respawn the town population,
garrison, or mutable old-ID state while a frozen old-ID operation remains valid.

- `git diff --check` passes for the stamped schema-54 update.
- `tools/validate-foundation.ps1` passes for the stamped schema-54 source tree,
  including all nine coordinator-integrated `garrison_patrol.*` fixtures and the
  ordered elapsed-time -> queue -> exact-garrison cleanup/tick -> mission-work
  runtime contract.
- The final stamped schema-54 tree identifies implementation
  `09a1470a4c27dbef866e8cbdba182a7df65fa027` in `HST_BuildInfo` and has clean
  headless Workbench Game-module compile/create evidence at 5,760 files/11,560
  classes with CRC `c62de929`; its normal WorldEditor open remained alive for ten
  samples over 20 seconds without a crash signature. Schema 54 has not been
  packaged or executed as gameplay proof. Source/compile/open gates are not
  packaged runtime certification.
- The stamped Schema-55 tree identifies implementation
  `552c2c4ff5ac7608fa248c614480a254769b61a4`. Its focused source proofs and full
  foundation gate pass; Workbench Game validation loads 5,763 files/11,570
  classes with CRC `0ec8950e`, and a normal WorldEditor open remains alive for
  ten samples over 20 seconds without a crash signature. Native projection/
  casualty behavior, real save/restart, rendered HVT guard status, owner-change,
  campaign-setup, packaged networking, reconnect, and JIP remain mandatory
  packaged gates.
- The stamped Schema-56 tree identifies implementation
  `bab5748d817ba434dae701cfbb3b92805d463678` and build label
  `schema56-exact-traitor-guard`, stamp
  `03a65cd33bee69c6320389803cdd5a2ec8576fb0`. The full foundation gate passes. Workbench Game
  validation loaded 5,764 files/11,573 classes with CRC `a18c67a5` and reported
  `Script validation successful`; a bounded hidden normal WorldEditor open stayed
  alive for all ten samples over 20 seconds, and its latest log had no script-
  error/crash signature. Native entities/adapter casualties, real save/restart,
  rendered UI, owner-change, campaign setup, packaged networking, reconnect, and
  JIP remain open.
- The stamped Schema-57 tree identifies implementation
  `514ebdcbeb1ddfb2a383b19590382517113e2ff6` and build label
  `schema57-exact-specops-guard`. The full foundation gate passes, including
  Schema-55/56/57. Stamped Workbench Game validation loaded 5,765 files/11,576
  classes with CRC `e0b8578e` and reported `Script validation successful`; the
  bounded hidden normal WorldEditor open stayed alive for 10/10 samples over 20
  seconds, and its log had no script-error/crash signature. All packaged/native/
  save-restart/rendered-UI/owner-change/setup/network/reconnect/JIP gates remain
  open.
- The stamped Schema-58 tree is an earlier source/Workbench baseline and
  identifies implementation `f0ba07ff2bc295d12542a3ea34b4c913e99b1869` with
  build label `schema58-exact-rescue-pows`. The full foundation gate passes,
  including the exact rescue authority checks. Final stamped-tree Workbench Game
  validation loaded 5,770 files/11,594 classes with CRC `aa73883a` and reported
  `Script validation successful`; the bounded hidden normal WorldEditor open
  stayed responsive for 10/10 samples over 20 seconds with zero crash/error
  matches. All packaged/native/save-restart/rendered-UI/owner-change/setup/
  network/reconnect/JIP gates remain open.
- The stamped Schema-59 tree identifies implementation
  `37fb5f0ffbc80c4bba3151ba1e5d8be6ffcf8a21` with build label
  `schema59-radio-site-lifecycle`. The full Foundation gate passes, including
  the durable radio-site lifecycle checks. Final stamped-tree Workbench Game
  validation loaded 5,773 files/11,608 classes with CRC `96914c26` and reported
  `Script validation successful`; the bounded hidden normal WorldEditor open
  stayed alive/responding for 10/10 samples over 20 seconds with no script-
  compile or crash signature. One Steamworks stats-request error was nonfatal.
  All packaged/native/save-restart/rendered-UI/owner-change/setup/network/
  reconnect/JIP gates remain open.
- The stamped Schema-60 source/Workbench tree records implementation
  `fdf78493dd15915afe8d53f61a8ad1efd65b5635`, UTC
  `2026-07-11T23:24:55Z`, label `schema60-exact-search-destroy`, Foundation pass
  with 644 symbol references, and Workbench CRC `7aa80fc9` at 5,777 files/11,615
  classes with successful game creation. Its correctly targeted hidden normal
  WorldEditor stayed alive/responding 10/10 samples over 20 seconds without a
  first-party error/crash signature. Both Schema-60 Campaign Debug proof services
  and the typed-QRF mismatch assertion are compiled/wired but unexecuted. No
  packaged server/client, actual save/restart, rendered UI, horn/stutter, or live
  behavior result is recorded here; Schema 59 remains preceding history.
- Schema 61 is the sealed marker-only authoritative client-projection boundary.
  Its deterministic proof service is not a
  packaged multiplayer artifact: it does not demonstrate a real host, two
  clients, disconnect/reconnect, late join, native widget roots, map close/
  reopen, process restart, or the absence of mixed-version clients.
- Schema 62 is an earlier sealed ownership source/Workbench checkpoint at
  implementation `7c93e0a485bcabe5a364c0b0cfeca235accb50f7`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T06:11:19Z`, and label
  `schema62-canonical-ownership-transition`. Foundation passes with 670 script-
  symbol references, and stamped-tree headless Workbench validation passes at
  5,785 files/11,652 classes with CRC `22c13a32` and zero script errors. Its
  bounded normal open remained responsive without a crash and zero Workbench
  processes survived. Campaign Debug, packaged behavior, actual restart,
  networking, reconnect, and JIP evidence remain open.
- Schema 64/settings 23 is the preceding sealed source/Workbench checkpoint for canonical town influence
  and political Map/War projection. Its deterministic assertions are wired.
  Foundation passes at 696 script-symbol references, including its dedicated
  gate. Normal Workbench compilation and all-five-configuration validation pass
  at 5,793 files/11,695 classes with CRC `36d5b017`, successful validation, zero
  HST script errors, and zero surviving Workbench processes. Campaign Debug,
  save/restart, packaged behavior, performance measurement, networking,
  reconnect, and JIP have not run. Its sealed identity is implementation
  `6f3c913eaed66926cce38b2ecafcff94084898a3`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T11:28:41Z`, label `schema64-canonical-town-influence`.
- The previous sealed Blueprint Phase 8 ambient-runtime checkpoint is sealed in source/
  Workbench at implementation `6afadc7c13681b78171939a740862e52328beffd`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T15:57:55Z`, and label
  `schema64-settings24-ambient-runtime-authority`. It keeps Campaign Schema 64,
  migrates runtime settings `23 -> 24`, passes Foundation at 711 references, and
  its stamped tree passes normal plus all-five Workbench validation at 5,799
  files/11,718 classes and CRC `bb083672`, with zero HST script errors and
  zero surviving processes. No Campaign Debug, packaged runtime, native brief
  enter/exit, actual autosave/restart, destruction/reset, Campaign Debug Phase 20
  production-path, or ten-town/ten-minute soak result exists yet.
- The earlier sealed Schema 65/settings 24 source/Workbench boundary contains
  source/Workbench boundary for the civilian-consequence slice described at the
  top of this audit. It identifies implementation
  `609add9eeadf73816764c497178e2d35081307d1`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T18:30:29Z`, and label
  `schema65-settings24-civilian-consequence-authority`. Final stamped normal/all-
  five Workbench checks are clean at 5,802 Game files/11,728 classes with CRC
  `c0a672b9`, `Script validation successful`, zero HST script errors, and zero
  surviving processes. Foundation passes at 717 script-symbol references; all
  runtime gates remain open. Do not publish or cite it as the Schema-64 ambient-runtime
  seal.
- Schema 66/settings 24 is an earlier sealed source/Workbench
  checkpoint. It identifies implementation
  `a7031797e67d99a99a066038cd8fa39efc03cff1`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T20:28:33Z`, and label
  `schema66-settings24-local-security-marker-integrity`. Its Foundation gate
  passes at 729 references and final Workbench checks pass at 5,806 files/11,740
  classes with CRC `ec860be7`, while Campaign Debug, native local security,
  rendered marker input,
  real restart, package, multiplayer, and soak remain open.
- Schema 67/settings 24 is the preceding sealed resource checkpoint at implementation
  `2798cb20b824ed74419ab6dc9bdce03f18ef71df`, UTC
  `2026-07-12T23:46:02Z`, and label
  `schema67-settings24-enemy-strategic-resource-authority`. Foundation passes at
  736 references. Final stamped normal/all-five Workbench checks pass at 5,809
  Game files/11,751 classes with CRC `a353fa0d`; all-five reports `Script
  validation successful` for WORKBENCH, PC, XBOX, PS4, and PS5, with zero HST
  script errors and zero surviving Workbench processes. No executed Campaign
  Debug or packaged runtime result is claimed in this audit.
- The prior Schema 68/settings 24 planning seal has the implementation identity,
  Foundation 744, and historical normal/all-five Workbench evidence recorded
  above. The bootstrap/profile/marker and commitment-aware planning seals remain
  historical checkpoints. The active engine-proof seal is implementation
  `4c9a94a1cb4811b6e75a7dca5dba70efffcb523d`, UTC
  `2026-07-13T15:43:01Z`, label
  `schema68-settings24-enemy-planning-engine-proof`, with final all-target
  Workbench CRC `5a998c21`. Its focused official engine autotest reports
  `AllExact=true` for all 17 deterministic planning fixtures, including retry-
  quarantine repeated-pass idempotency, but it has no Full Campaign Debug
  `HST_Dev` coordinator artifact, live-authority result, or packaged-runtime
  result. The latest `f97b12e` package exposed fresh `-67`/`-68` quarantine and
  598 warnings; it created canonical data but had no retired tree. Do not report
  that package as proof of any later correction.
- Sealed Schema 63 passes Foundation with 681 script-symbol references. A
  normal Workbench Script Editor open compiled/created the Game module at 5,788
  files/11,670 classes with CRC `a40056c5`, no HST script errors, and no crash.
  Explicit validation passed for WORKBENCH, PC, XBOX, PS4, and PS5 with exit
  code `0` and reported `Script validation successful`. All Workbench instances
  were closed after the test. This is source/compile/validation evidence only;
  Campaign Debug, packaged behavior, actual restart, networking, reconnect, and
  JIP remain open.

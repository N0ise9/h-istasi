## Release decision

**NO-GO - development alpha.** No release-candidate package is certified.

The retained candidate identity below binds its exact source HEAD, manifest, canonical four-file package index, addon identity, and validation tools. The generator verifies that the candidate source is between the audited gameplay revision and the live checkout HEAD.

## Proof ladder

A pass never inherits upward. `partial` means some scoped evidence exists but the rung is not passed for the enabled campaign.

| Rung | Status | Honest scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static/source/resource contracts | `passed` | Retained Foundation evidence is green inside the immutable candidate build for its exact source HEAD. |
| Enforce compile and configuration | `passed` | All five explicit Workbench targets are retained and green for the candidate source and canonical four-file package build. |
| Deterministic service contracts | `not-run` | The 91 individually named packaged focused cases have not run against the active package; historical focused results do not transfer. |
| Native engine-world behavior | `not-run` | The same-package release-surface/runtime-retention pair passed and was independently consumed as noncertifying evidence. The 91-case focused aggregate, corrected force-authority canary, and Full Campaign Debug remain pending; historical runtime results do not transfer. |
| Packaged dedicated server | `not-run` | The active candidate has not entered the standard dedicated-server certification gate. |
| Multiple clients, reconnect, and JIP | `not-run` | Host, two-client, reconnect, late-join, and packet-disruption convergence are not certified. |
| Fresh-process restart and fault injection | `partial` | Selected journal, shutdown, field-vehicle, exact-QRF, counterattack, and rebuild cuts pass; the arbitrary full campaign graph and fault matrix remain open. |
| Performance and long soak | `not-run` | The reported one-second hitch and long-campaign capacity limits have no current immutable-package soak evidence. |
| Canary release | `blocked` | Blocked until the active package passes every lower Gate 1 proof boundary. |
| Stable certification | `blocked` | No current matrix row is certified. The active package passed its first noncertifying runtime boundary, while focused, canary, full-profile, and later external gates remain open. |

## Retained evidence

- Foundation: **passed** at 985 references for `5b1f2e98f93137230e686312c6e99cea7630dae4`.
- Workbench: **passed** at 5849 files / 12022 classes / CRC `aeddce9b` for `5b1f2e98f93137230e686312c6e99cea7630dae4`.

Candidate binding `06b5fa23ccd10bfd1f8621f6b03c25d9c36719cc9c7d08ebcc73dabbba8c9f5f`; 41 files revalidated; policy `script-engine-and-process-fatal-v1` diagnostic census 6 raw lines / 2 events = 6 / 2 approved stock + 0 / 0 unapproved across 1 clean mode(s) and 1 exact stock-cluster mode(s); tracked index `docs/evidence/release-surface-audit/partisan-rc-5b1f2e98f931-20260721T193941Z-20260722T103329Z-edea9d8417884dd8a2d2b313c4543ad0.json` / SHA-256 `205f9c2d2c3166bced4e92312ded1d16a633518732fad748b5178628e59d75b6`; ready SHA-256 `7201bb54caccd48ee270bb34a9eba5e5e09596ea33b9855b9cbf5a2499c6a43a`; clean harness `e2c38d2770d8ebaaa675326d1b8a91068db989e5`. Certification promotion is `none`: this proves the contracted loaded-package surface boundary only and makes no package-byte string-absence claim for the nine source-guarded literals.
- Active Gate 1 runtime retention: **passed-noncertifying-retention** from `2026-07-22T10:35:14.8010942+00:00` through `2026-07-22T10:41:14.7913808+00:00` on run `gate1_20260722T103514Z_436f331b86594c5bb94f` / leaf `20260722T103514Z-436f331b8659`.

Certification claim is `none` and standard-save restoration certified is `false`; this scoped retention evidence does not advance a later release rung.
- Active packaged focused autotests: **not run** for replacement candidate `partisan-rc-5b1f2e98f931-20260721T193941Z`; no prior-package result transfers to this package.
- Active Campaign Debug: **not run** for replacement candidate `partisan-rc-5b1f2e98f931-20260721T193941Z`; the corrected canary follows only after the packaged focused set is accepted.
- Focused force-authority profile: **35/35** cases and **87/87** counted conditions for `32727238d74b29905c68e5a80bb5897dfdc783c0`, with `CertificationPassed:false`. This is historical state-only, non-package, non-certifying evidence.
- Historical packaged focused autotests: **5/5** cases and JUnit **5/0/0/0** tests/failures/errors/skips against prior exact candidate `partisan-rc-0e632ec4f63e-20260719T004133Z`. Hard diagnostics are explicitly not free: 11 total = 10 approved stock + 1 approved intentional + 0 unapproved, with 40 envelope files rehashed and zero cleanup/spill residue.

This immutable non-certifying result does not attach to the active replacement.
- Historical corrected force-authority canary: **accepted non-certifying** on prior exact candidate `partisan-rc-0e632ec4f63e-20260719T004133Z`. The focused proof passed 35/35 assertions and 87/87 counted certification conditions. The 33-check classifier found 2 hard diagnostics = 2 approved stock + 0 approved intentional + 0 unapproved. All 10 envelope files rehashed with zero cleanup/spill residue.

This immutable scoped acceptance does not transfer to the active replacement.
- Historical Full Campaign Debug: **rejected, red full profile** on prior exact candidate `partisan-rc-0e632ec4f63e-20260719T004133Z`. The wrapper capture completed mechanically with stable artifacts, 10 rehashed envelope files, and zero cleanup/spill residue, while runtime acceptance remained false. Certification stayed red at 584 PASS, 49 WARN, 46 FAIL, 7 BLOCKED, and 1 SKIPPED with 5561/5687 required assertions proven, 112 failed, and 14 blocked. The fail-closed classifier found 25 hard diagnostics = 2 approved stock + 13 approved intentional + 10 unapproved.

Mechanical capture success is not certification or diagnostic acceptance, and this immutable rejection does not attach to the active replacement.

This immutable rejection does not transfer to the active replacement.
- Historical Full Campaign Debug: **stopped and not run** for prior exact candidate `partisan-rc-e11e7ea88a44-20260719T040154Z`; its `rejected-after-corrected-canary` contract ended the chain at the rejected corrected canary.

## Specification coverage

- CE 3.11.1 product contract rows: **24** (development-only 1; legacy 3; missing 2; partial 18).
- Configured/runtime mission rows: **39/39**, all mapped to a product contract row.
- Routed command/action IDs: **177**, exact source/manifest set match and all mapped.
- Concrete contextual action classes: **17**, exact source/manifest set match and all mapped.
- Product specification: `docs/ANTISTASI_CE311_PARITY_MATRIX.md`.

Coverage means the surface is named and classified. It does not mean the behavior is exact or certified.

## Active blockers

| ID | Category | Blocker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STATUS-001` | `AUTH` | The active Gate 1 candidate has green Foundation, all-target Workbench, and same-package paired release-surface/runtime-retention evidence. The 91-case focused aggregate, corrected canary, and Full Campaign Debug are still required; no historical result transfers. |
| `STATUS-002` | `TEST` | Run and independently consume the 91-case packaged focused set against the unchanged candidate, then the corrected force-authority canary, and only after an accepted canary run Full Campaign Debug. |
| `STATUS-003` | `UI` | Known command-menu and modal-map defects remain open until source correction plus rendered packaged-client proof. |
| `STATUS-004` | `MOVE` | Natural sustained infantry and convoy travel, identical-waypoint suppression, and measured no-stutter behavior are not proven. |
| `STATUS-005` | `PROJ` | Campaign read-model convergence is not proven with host, two clients, reconnect, JIP, restart, and marker-cap boundaries. |
| `STATUS-006` | `PERF` | The one-second hitch and bounded-history admission cliffs remain unclosed. |
| `STATUS-007` | `MISSION` | Configured mission breadth still exceeds mission-specific CE 3.11.1 behavioral parity and proof. |

## Next release-closure step

Run the individually named packaged focused service suites next against active replacement `partisan-rc-5b1f2e98f931-20260721T193941Z`, manifest `docs/evidence/release-candidates/partisan-rc-5b1f2e98f931-20260721T193941Z/candidate.json`, and aggregate package SHA-256 `af22d6322a215dbef466e49041fc07395cbb5ed7a5951fd3e0cee5f4a101f530`. If that exact-package set is accepted, run the corrected force-authority canary next; do not transfer the historical candidate's pass or rejection into either gate.

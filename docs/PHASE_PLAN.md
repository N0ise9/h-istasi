# h-istasi Phase Plan

This roadmap is the working implementation plan for h-istasi. It is meant to be
updated as phases complete, split, or get refined through HST_Dev smoke tests.

Status legend:

- Complete: implemented, validated statically, and smoke-tested enough to move on.
- In progress: current active slice.
- Planned: accepted direction, not implemented yet.

Current-state authority in this document is intentionally narrow: the CRI table,
Blueprint Milestone Snapshot, Current Implementation Baseline, and Next
Engineering Milestones are current. The numbered phase sections preserve
acceptance detail and implementation history; they do not override
`FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md` or the runtime-evidence audit.

## Definition Of Done For Every Phase

Every phase should leave the project in a state that can be tested by a human
in HST_Dev and inspected through a clear server-side report path. Unless a phase
explicitly says otherwise, completion means:

- `tools/validate-foundation.ps1` passes or is intentionally extended and then
  passes.
- HST_Dev can launch far enough to exercise the changed system.
- The changed feature has a command-menu report, debug action, or log path that
  exposes its important runtime state.
- Campaign mutations remain server-authoritative and flow through services.
- Persistent campaign state does not store raw `IEntity` references.
- Missing Reforger APIs, invalid resources, unavailable services, or fragile
  runtime calls fail with visible reasons and preserve campaign state.
- No hidden addon dependency, non-base-game asset assumption, or save migration
  is introduced unless the phase explicitly calls for it.
- Phase status in this document is updated when the phase is completed.

## Current Baseline

h-istasi is already past the blank-project stage. The repository has a
versioned mission-registry baseline, server-side campaign/economy/mission/
persistence/checkpoint services, player/HQ/Petros setup, custom arsenal, loot,
vehicle cargo, virtual garage/build scaffolding, loadout editor code, generated
Everon sites/routes, mission objectives, physical mission primitives, support
requests, enemy commander orders, civilian/undercover state, and an
h-istasi command menu.

The current server runtime is centered on
`HST_CampaignCoordinatorComponent`. It instantiates services, restores or
creates campaign state, tracks persistence, refreshes markers, restores nearby
field vehicles, and then ticks mission timers, objectives, mission runtime,
convoy runtime/outcomes, income, enemy resources, aggression decay, civilians,
support requests, enemy orders, HQ runtime objects, physical zone activation,
zone capture, and civilian population.

The state model already has the right campaign save-game spine:

- faction pools
- players
- zones
- garrisons
- active groups
- QRFs
- map markers
- arsenal items
- garage vehicles
- vehicle cargo
- runtime vehicles
- saved loadouts
- issued loadout items
- captured emplacements
- ammo points
- active missions
- generated sites
- generated routes
- mission objectives
- mission runtime entities
- mission assets
- support requests
- canonical exact operation records for both infantry QRFs, mission convoy,
  enemy and purchased-garrison patrols, all three assassination guards, and
  newly started POW rescue across schemas 50-58
- enemy orders
- civilian zone state
- undercover records
- campaign tasks
- monotonic authority sequence
- bounded command receipts
- resource transactions
- bounded campaign events

The plan should harden each existing service into a playable, testable vertical
slice. It should not rebuild the foundation.

## Campaign Runtime Integrity Program

Campaign Runtime Integrity (CRI) is the active dependency-ordered delivery gate.
The active development contract is Schema 58: only newly started `rescue_pows`
gain mission-rescue contract `1`, policy `exact_rescue_pows_v1`, intent
`rescue_pows_guard`, and quarantine `-58`. The aggregate owns one frozen guard
roster and exactly three typed captive slots with stable escort/carrier/seat and
casualty/extraction receipts. Historical POWs, `rescue_refugees`, ordinary
`mission_group_*` rows, and every unsupported family remain contract `0`.
Schema 58 is the current stamped source/Workbench baseline at implementation
`f0ba07ff2bc295d12542a3ea34b4c913e99b1869` with build label
`schema58-exact-rescue-pows`. The full foundation gate passes. The final stamped
tree passed Workbench Game validation at 5,770 files/11,594
classes with CRC `aa73883a` and `Script validation successful`; its bounded
normal WorldEditor open stayed alive for 10/10 samples over 20 seconds with zero
crash/error matches. These are source/compiler/startup gates only. Packaged/
native/save-restart/rendered-UI/owner-change/setup/network/reconnect/JIP gates
remain open. Schema 57 remains the preceding historical checkpoint at
implementation `514ebdcbeb1ddfb2a383b19590382517113e2ff6` with build label
`schema57-exact-specops-guard`.
It supersedes feature-order implications in the legacy numbered roadmap below;
that roadmap remains useful for feature history and acceptance detail.

| Stage | Status | Exit condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CRI-0: Repository truth and baseline | Schema 58 is the current stamped source/Workbench checkpoint | Publish and runtime-prove the Schema-58 artifact. The final stamped tree passed full foundation, Workbench Game validation at 5,770 files/11,594 classes with CRC `aa73883a`, and 10/10 normal-open samples over 20 seconds with zero crash/error matches. Every packaged/native/save-restart/rendered-UI/owner-change/setup/network/reconnect/JIP gate remains independently open. |
| CRI-1: Campaign authority foundation | Implemented foundation; runtime proof pending | Schema 58 adds only the new-POW mission/operation/composite-manifest/external-batch/guard/three-captive graph. Historical POWs, refugees, unsupported families, and ordinary mission-group rows remain contract `0`; malformed strong claimants quarantine at `-58` without fallback, guessed death/extraction, or reward. |
| CRI-2: Exact force manifests | Foundation complete; expansion pending | SpawnQueue executes the Schema-58 guard root/member subgraph and explicitly excludes its three external captive slots. The mission-rescue service owns those typed asset rows. Existing QRF/patrol/guard/convoy shapes remain unchanged; generic vehicle/asset/multi-root execution and packaged proof remain open. |
| CRI-3 through CRI-5: Force runtime, operations, virtualization, and movement | In progress; nine exact family projections across seven operation types implemented in source | Schema 58 keeps guard and captive outcomes separate, folds unbound POWs without virtual damage, retains custody projections, preserves exact deaths/receipts through restore, and settles normal failure/success plus custody-only grace. Generalized encounters, historical forces/missions, other families, and packaged movement/fold/restart proof remain open. |
| CRI-6 through CRI-8: Client projection, ownership, and civilian influence | Broad-alpha foundations implemented; source repairs await publish | The packaged schema-49 check proved stock HUD/Game Master recovery but exposed invalid radio icons, owner-only labels, pointer layering, duplicate transmitters, HQ-coupled civilian eligibility, repeated appearances, horns, and locality misclassification. Schema-50 source validates dynamic radio icons, labels location plus owner, fixes map-local layering, reuses authored towers, separates civilian eligibility, defaults true-town traffic to five, varies concrete actors, resets ambient horns, and treats the woodland locality as minor. Snapshot/delta/JIP authority, packaged repair proof, canonical ownership side effects, and deeper political consequences remain open. |
| CRI-9 through CRI-11: Enemy commander, missions, and progression | Broad-alpha foundations implemented; two exact enemy orders, convoy, all assassination guards, first rescue slice, and one exact purchased-garrison policy source-complete | Existing exact families retain narrow boundaries. Schema 58 adds only newly started `rescue_pows`; historical POWs, refugees, other rescue/mission families, aggregate forces, broader vehicle policy, runtime proof, mission depth, and tuning remain open. |
| CRI-12: Certification | Planned | Isolated dedicated-server, reconnect/JIP, save/load, long-soak, and migration evidence closes the program. |

### Blueprint Milestone Snapshot

| Player-visible milestone | Current state | Next proof boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exact Forces | Implemented foundation plus policy-v2 purchased-garrison, all three assassination-guard slices, and the first composite rescue slice | Execute exact training, garrison/QRF/queue, all three assassination contracts, the Schema-58 guard-plus-three-captive graph, typed settlement, and replay cases across save/restart. |
| Clean Forces | First exact infantry-QRF lifecycle plus legacy mixed-group personnel terminal repair implemented | Prove native/GM/strategic living counts, corpse detachment, last-death cleanup, survivor reprojection, and one crewless mixed-QRF salvage transition across restart. |
| Living War | Broad-alpha paths plus nine exact family projections are in source | Prove all exact infantry rosters, the three-element convoy, and the three-POW rescue aggregate through materialization/fold/re-entry; separately prove casualty, carrier/seat, outcome, grace, and restart behavior. |
| Reliable Orders | Exact player QRF, newly planned enemy defensive QRF, and newly queued enemy patrol have separate canonical operation policies; other orders remain broad-alpha | Runtime-prove immutable assignment, duty/materialization/engagement/return/settlement/restart behavior, type/version dispatch, and legacy isolation, then extend the contract one family at a time. |
| One Campaign View | Menu and marker projections exist; schema-50 radio-icon, location/owner label, cursor-layer, and transmitter-reuse repairs are source-only | Prove the reported map/dialog/radio cases, then authoritative host/client/late-join snapshots, revisions, deletes, and modal map ownership. |
| Political Map | Town influence, capture, ownership, security, and heat foundations exist | Canonicalize ownership side effects and deepen political control/mission outputs. |
| Living Towns | Civilian pedestrians/traffic moved in packaged schema 49; schema-50 eligibility, taxonomy, diversity, five-car true-town default, and horn repairs are source-only | Prove Figari/Morton and minor-locality budgets, zero unregistered group RPCs, distinct actors, silent moving traffic, cleanup/recycle, and strategic consequences. |
| Enemy Commander | Resource pools, scoring, broad legacy orders, exact defensive-QRF, and exact newly queued patrol operations exist | Prove each debit/roster/policy independently: QRF defensive arrival/return and patrol generated-route contact/lap/return, exact casualties, proportional settlement, marker cleanup, restart, and long-window behavior. |
| Mission Parity | All 39 configured IDs map to MVP primitives; convoy, all assassination guards, and newly started `rescue_pows` use narrow exact contracts | Runtime-prove convoy, all three assassination guards, and Schema-58 rescue. Keep refugees, historical POWs, and other mission families legacy until their own explicit cutovers. |
| Resistance Progression | Arsenal, garage, training, undercover, HQ/Petros, and end-state foundations exist | Complete exact logistics/loadouts/static defenses and tune the full progression loop. |
| Campaign Certification | Packaged schema-49 restored Game Master/stock HUD; stamped Schema 58 adds source/Workbench authority but is not packaged proof | Publish and runtime-prove Schema 58, including marker/civilian/radio, both QRFs, convoy, patrols, garrison, all assassination guards, and the three-POW rescue, before dedicated-server, JIP/reconnect, restart/migration, fault-injection, and long-soak gates. |

CRI-1 and the first CRI-2 vertical slices remain intentionally narrow. Troop
training is the first production ledger consumer; exact visible garrison
confirmation is the second, and exact player QRF is the first paid executable
support consumer. Support recall is the first visible command to map a typed
domain result into explicit durable receipt status and aggregate identity;
other visible commands still use the compatibility classifier. Other command and cost paths remain on their legacy service
contracts until their dependency stage supplies the required exact quote,
manifest, or operation model. Schema 47 retains the bounded runtime scheduler
and native adapter for one exact infantry group root plus exact members, feeds it
the accepted QRF manifest, and restores only durable survivors. Existing broad-alpha physicalization paths do not
become exact merely because this first slice exists; only projections carrying
the explicit queue-owned identity use it, and the legacy guards hold those
specific projections rather than silently migrating unrelated groups.
Schema 49 supplies that operation model only for newly confirmed exact paid
player infantry QRFs and uniquely coherent accepted nonterminal schema-48 rows.
Schema 50 adds strategic route, materialization, exact virtual roster, and
bounded virtual-combat authority to the same infantry-only player consumer.
Schema 51 applies the shared exact route/roster/projection boundary only to
newly planned infantry-only enemy defensive QRF orders, with a separate
arrival-pressure, return-origin, and survivor-resource settlement policy.
Schema 52 applies a separate exact route/roster/projection boundary only to
newly started convoy missions: exactly three vehicles, three crew groups,
optional vehicle-zero cargo/captive, generated-route virtual travel, physical
intercept/fold, casualty persistence, and once-only mission-outcome settlement.
Schema 53 applies the shared one-root infantry projection boundary only to newly
queued enemy patrol orders, with generated-route outbound travel, one closed
lap, physical contact hold, fold/reprojection, return-origin duty, and proactive
  survivor settlement. Schema 54 then applies the same adapter boundary only to
  newly issued policy-v2 purchased resistance garrisons, using an empty
  executable root, arbitrary exact member roster, infinite local loop,
  survivor-only reprojection, and no-refund terminal policy. Schema 55 applies a
  route-less empty-root/member guard contract only to newly started
  `assassinate_officer` missions at version `1`. Schema 56 adds the same exact
  survivor/HVT-separated lifecycle only to newly started `assassinate_traitor`
  guards at contract `2`/policy `exact_assassinate_traitor_guard_v1`, with `-56`
  quarantine and conservative pre-56 migration. Schema 57 adds it only to newly
  started `assassinate_specops` guards at contract `3`, policy
  `exact_assassinate_specops_guard_v1`, intent `assassinate_specops_guard`, and
  `-57` conflict quarantine. Its restore path records
  `migration_schema57_exact_specops_guard`; conflicts record
  `normalization_schema57_exact_specops_guard_conflict`. Ordinary
  `mission_group_*` rows are not claimants. Historical/pre-opt-in assassination
  missions, policy-v1/aggregate garrisons, rescue and other unsupported mission/
  order families, and vehicle/multi-root forces remain legacy. All three guard
  paths are HVT-separated, route-less, survivor/casualty preserving across
  materialize-fold-re-entry, zero-refund, and excluded from virtual combat.

## Current Implementation Baseline

The codebase now includes the core implementation pieces that older phase rows
treated as future work:

- `HST_ForceCompositionService` owns request/result force planning for support,
  mission guards, garrison activation, QRFs, counterattacks, convoy guards, HQ
  attacks, and debug probes.
- `HST_ForceCatalogService`, `HST_ForcePlanningService`, and
  `HST_ForcePlanningIntegrityService` own versioned exact execution-prefab
  catalogs, immutable manifest/quote planning, and deterministic integrity.
- `HST_OperationService` owns shared version-1 transition authority for
  confirmed exact paid player infantry QRFs and newly planned exact enemy
  defensive QRFs, and supplies deterministic settlement identity to the
  schema-52 mission-convoy owner. The QRF operations preserve immutable origin/assignment separately from
  tactical target and validate queue/handoff, projection, restore, settlement,
  and replay transitions. Schema 50 adds the player direct-route and virtual-
  combat policy; schema 51 adds reciprocal enemy-order identity, outbound/
  return duty, two-sample physical arrival, defensive pressure, and typed
  survivor-resource settlement. `HST_MissionConvoyOperationService` separately
  owns the schema-52 convoy route, projection, arrival, and mission-outcome
  settlement policy. Live physical
  combat does not yet drive player engagement, and no other operation family is opted in.
- `HST_EnemyQRFOperationService` owns the enemy defensive-QRF admission and
  tick policy. It freezes one infantry roster from a distinct same-faction
  operational source for a same-faction defended target under resistance pressure, admits one held aggregate after
  the prepaid debit, suppresses parallel legacy authority, applies arrival
  pressure once, returns survivors to origin, and settles once or fails closed.
- `HST_MissionConvoyOperationService` owns newly started exact convoy missions.
  It freezes one generated route, exactly three vehicle/crew elements and
  ordered crew slots, and mission-kind-compatible cargo/captive on vehicle zero.
  It advances them
  virtually, requests/observes the PhysicalWar projection near players, folds
  only when clear, preserves exact casualties, retains terminal-vehicle
  survivors as crew-only roots without vehicle resurrection, confirms arrival
  from route authority, and records one terminal receipt after the normal
  convoy outcome. Bubble ownership includes separated living/recovery roots.
- `HST_MissionConvoyP1Policy` owns exact-convoy cargo cardinality/role/kind/
  entity-prefab admission and legal lifecycle pairs.
  `HST_MissionConvoySaveValidationService` owns conservative schema-52
  migration, claimant validation, quarantine, and restore normalization.
- Exact-convoy persistence reconciles mapped physical members before every real
  capture. An open publication transaction or ambiguous mapping defers capture,
  flush, and savepoint request while retaining intent for bounded retry.
- `HST_StrategicMovementService` owns the two exact infantry-QRF consumers'
  direct campaign cursor at 2.5 m/s, derives ETA from distance, and limits
  catch-up to 30 campaign seconds per invocation.
- `HST_MaterializationService` owns their separate player-bubble in/out
  thresholds; the larger exit radius prevents projection thrash and contact
  blocks folding where that consumer owns engagement state.
- `HST_VirtualCombatService` owns only on-station exact infantry-QRF combat
  against hostile abstract infantry at the target. It processes deterministic
  30-second steps, at most four per tick, and retires exact friendly slots while
  persisting both sides' fractional damage carry.
- `HST_OperationProjectionProofService` adds movement, hysteresis, exact roster-
  transfer, and combat/restore assertions beside the existing operation-record
  fixture. Source fixtures are not packaged runtime proof.
- `HST_EnemyQRFOperationProofService` adds six deterministic enemy admission,
  legacy-isolation, projection, settlement, restore, and rejection fixtures.
  They exercise in-process authority only; packaged AI movement, rendering,
  accounting, and real process restart remain open.
- `HST_MissionConvoyOperationProofService` adds nine aggregate assertions. Its
  admission/corruption subfixtures cover invalid cargo, foreign authority, seat
  topology, forged arrival receipts, legal lifecycle pairs, non-member casualty
  rejection, and missionless durable-claimant preservation. They remain source
  fixtures, not packaged engine proof.
- `HST_ForceSpawnQueueService` owns durable request/result/projection identity,
  exact required-slot admission, two-batch/eight-action tick acquisition,
  retry/deadline/cancellation cleanup, verified callbacks, 64-batch/512-slot
  active bounds, 64 slots per request, 128 terminal rows with explicit pins and
  a 600-second minimum retention window, production reporting, and once-per-
  restore reconciliation. Cleanup acquisition is dependency ordered as assets,
  members, vehicles, then group roots across bounded waves. Schema-50 strategic
  holds suspend physical queue work and make frozen member slots the exact
  virtual roster. Terminal entity/native-group IDs are historical evidence
  cleared on restore, not a living roster.
- `HST_ForceSpawnAdapterService` consumes queue work from the coordinator's
  one-second active-phase tick. The implemented slice accepts exactly one
  infantry group root with its required member slots, verifies exact prefab,
  liveness, faction, native group, Game Master hierarchy, and projection links,
  then records durable nonterminal `READY_FOR_HANDOFF`. It runs only after a
  held virtual projection is released for materialization, finalizes the exact
  group in `HST_PhysicalWarService` before `CompleteProjectionHandoff` records
  `SUCCEEDED`. Unsupported vehicle, asset, or multi-root manifests fail closed
  rather than materializing a shorter force.
- `HST_PhysicalWarService` exposes the narrow exact registration/handoff bridge
  and holds legacy spawn, member-repair, survivor, route, patrol, and cleanup
  paths while a queue-owned projection is not ready. This prevents duplicate
  broad-alpha population without changing unrelated physical-war ownership.
- HQ safety no longer uses one 900m rule for every purpose. That radius remains
  the hostile operation-staging exclusion; whole-location activation uses the
  location capture footprint with a 150m fallback, and static composition
  clearance uses 150m. The split is source-only until the next packaged test.
- Setup and won/lost phases do not run normal spawn acquisition. Instead, they
  request cancellation for every nonterminal batch and drain dependency-ordered
  cleanup with a monotonic runtime-only clock that does not advance campaign
  elapsed time. Schema-50/51 restore clears process-local IDs and normalizes
  every opted-in nonterminal exact infantry QRF—pending, interrupted handoff,
  or prior physical success—to one held virtual batch with the same exact
  survivor and casualty slots. A later materialization releases only survivors;
  the enemy slice additionally clears process-local physical-arrival samples.
  Player-paid infantry QRF and newly planned enemy defensive QRF use this
  production path; other support/order families remain on legacy services.
  Schema-54 policy-v2 purchased resistance garrisons now use one executable
  `NotSpawned` container root plus their arbitrary exact member slots, begin in
  held virtual local patrol, and rematerialize only durable survivors. Historical
  policy-v1, initial/enemy aggregate and vehicle garrisons remain legacy.
  Event-driven physical casualty subscription, vehicle/asset/multi-root
  lifecycle, other force consumers, and packaged physical/restart proof remain
  open.
- `HST_SpawnPlacementService` owns request/result placement for QRF staging, HQ
  attack standoff, convoy endpoints, dry-ground checks, vehicle-safe placement,
  road preference, and HQ standoff.
- Physical support deployments persist their resolved route id, placement
  type/summary, target/road/HQ distances, road resolution, vehicle-safe result,
  and linked active-group force counts so one-button debug can inspect the
  support request -> active group -> fold-back chain through save/load.
- Eligible unspawned non-queue-managed legacy support/QRF groups can still
  advance through their existing abstract policy. Each opted-in exact infantry
  QRF instead begins as a held queue projection and advances from its persistent
  direct-route cursor without a nearby player. Both materialize exact survivors
  inside the player bubble and fold the live position/roster outside the larger
  exit radius. The player policy can resolve bounded virtual infantry combat on
  station; the enemy policy applies one defensive-pressure outcome and returns
  to origin for proportional survivor settlement.
- Materialized support retains the living-member centroid instead of elapsed-
  time interpolation. ETA opens the arrival check; two live samples from
  distinct elapsed seconds within 75m confirm physical arrival or recall exit.
  Exact QRF handoff normalizes to `support_active` so the same physical route
  owner observes it until it folds again.
- Populated spawned support receives a direct route from the current live
  position through a safe midpoint to the current target or recall exit. Stalled
  chains have a maximum of three consecutive reissues until an 8m new-best
  distance improvement resets the stall budget. Replacement is transactional:
  prepare a complete service-owned chain first, retain the old chain on failure,
  and remove/delete the old waypoints before attaching the replacement.
- Vehicle-capable support/QRF active groups now persist their selected vehicle
  prefab and spawn a linked runtime vehicle entity when the infantry group
  becomes live. Runtime vehicle roots are recursively cleared of engine faction
  claims so selected faction catalogs do not make the spawned vehicles
  player-unusable.
- Mixed personnel/vehicle groups no longer use an intact empty vehicle as a
  substitute for living personnel. After population was observed and both
  population guards expire, zero living infantry terminally clears strategic
  infantry/vehicle strength, resolves an incomplete linked QRF as failed,
  removes capture/marker pressure, and releases an intact vehicle as unclaimed
  `detached_active_vehicle` session salvage unless it already owns a durable
  field/loot/garage record, in which case that record and cargo remain durable.
  Terminal save normalization keeps
  those counts at zero. Vehicle-only projections and mission convoys retain
  their separate policies.
- Enemy support ledgers track recent damage pressure, cooldowns, max defense
  spend, same-zone stacking, and survivor refunds. Proactive background-war and
  HQ-pressure orders spend attack resources only, while QRFs, capture-triggered
  counterattacks, rebuilds, roadblocks, and direct enemy support requests spend
  support resources through the ledger.
- Enemy commander target scoring is relation-aware: same-faction holdings,
  resistance-held zones, and rival-held zones have distinct owner-score reasons,
  while hideout and mission-site bookkeeping anchors are excluded. Full
  Campaign Debug also proves the related order-type branches for counterattack,
  QRF, rebuild, roadblock, and rival support-call decisions.
- Static location map markers are visually separated from QRF tactical response
  markers. Towns, base/outpost/seaport/airfield locations, and mission-site
  anchors publish non-QRF icon hints. Schema-50 source resolves the radio icon
  by validated resource identity rather than a hard-coded array index, labels
  each zone with location and owner, and keeps the native map pointer above the
  support confirmation dialog. It also retains one nearby authored transmitter
  for a radio composition and lets destroy-target missions borrow it safely.
  The packaged map/dialog/radio proof remains open.
- Civilian town influence events track support, reputation, heat, population,
  police, roadblock, active/expired modifier counts, and political ownership
  consequences.
- Civilian/vehicle heat and undercover enforcement already cover request/apply,
  wanted heat, vehicle reports, passenger compromise, police/roadblock scans,
  and explicit reports.
- Civilian runtime classification now distinguishes stock town centers from
  minor localities. Nearby ambience no longer depends on the hostile military-
  active bit, true towns default to five driven vehicles, the known woodland
  locality receives two pedestrians and no town traffic, concrete appearance
  selection avoids same-town duplicates, and HST-owned ambient driver horn
  input is cleared. These source repairs need republished behavior proof.
- Category mission selection is active: commander mission starts select a
  category, then the server chooses a valid definition and nearby eligible
  target.
- Campaign end rules now default to population support plus all-airfield
  control for victory and killed population greater than one third for loss,
  with legacy control-percent victory remaining optional.

## Next Engineering Milestones

1. Commit and stamp the clean schema-52 implementation, then publish it and
   runtime-prove the schema-50
   marker/dialog/radio repairs while
   preserving the already restored stock HUD and Game Master access. Require
   valid-sized icons, location-plus-owner labels, pointer-over-dialog ordering,
   one authored transmitter per existing site, correct radio mission binding,
   and no recursive role-change exception during late admin assignment.
2. Runtime-prove civilian classification and projection: zero unregistered group
   RPCs, distinct actors, five moving vehicles per true town, two pedestrians at
   the minor woodland locality, no stuck horns, and Figari/Morton ambience even
   when HQ safety suppresses hostile military activation.
3. Runtime-prove campaign-debug isolation, the six repaired observations, and a
   clean development-session restart before interpreting a new full artifact.
4. Prove the schema-43 through schema-52 authority chain across exact training,
   garrison, paid-QRF, SpawnQueue, strategic movement, materialization/fold
   hysteresis, exact casualty/survivor transfer, bounded virtual combat, archive
   replay, typed recall receipt status, operation migration/settlement, paired-
   settlement rejection, enemy defensive-QRF prepaid admission, duplicate-path
   suppression, arrival/return/proportional settlement, and save/restart
   boundaries.
5. Prove the schema-52 exact convoy's frozen generated route, three linked
   vehicle/crew elements, optional cargo/captive on vehicle zero, virtual travel,
   3/3 drivers, physical interception, contact-to-clear transition, non-suffix
   member death identity, partial crewless-vehicle reprojection/capture, cargo-
   only terminal recovery, detached player-bound cargo fold, duplicate-free
   garage handoff, casualty-preserving fold/rematerialization, two-sample arrival,
   once-only outcome/settlement, aggregate current/destination marker cleanup,
   and restart. In scoped disposable profiles, also prove actual
   support movement, two consecutive live arrival samples within 75m, physical
   recall exit, and transactional waypoint replacement within the three-reissue
   cap. Reproduce the mixed-QRF zero-personnel case and prove one neutral
   salvage detach, zero capture/marker pressure, no duplicate record, and
   restart-stable terminal state.
6. After the focused marker cases pass, prove authoritative host/client/JIP
   snapshot-and-delta reconciliation for the One Campaign View milestone.
7. Runtime-prove both exact-QRF `OperationRecord` policies. For the player path,
   cover issue/confirmation, virtual combat, recall, archive, and ledger replay.
   For the enemy defensive path, cover one frozen debit, outbound/return travel,
   two-sample arrival, defensive pressure, exact casualties, proportional refund,
   marker cleanup, and legacy isolation. Cover physical/virtual transfer and
   restore for both before extending lifecycle authority to vehicles, assets,
   garrisons, and remaining support/order consumers.
8. Runtime-prove schema 53 exact newly queued enemy patrol operations: one
   proactive debit, one frozen infantry roster, outbound travel, physical
   materialization/fold with mapped casualties, contact-held progress, one
   closed on-station lap, return, survivor refund, marker cleanup, and restart.
   Historical patrols remain contract version `0`; quarantine version `-53`
   never enters a legacy owner.
9. Runtime-prove schema 54 exact purchased-garrison patrol operations: only a
   newly issued policy-v2 resistance purchase creates one exact arbitrary member
   roster under an empty root, virtual infinite local loop, survivor-only
   materialization/fold, exact marker/UI row, and owner-change/all-dead/campaign-
   stop/setup or typed spawn/route-failure terminal receipt with zero refund.
   Save/restart and JIP must preserve
   cursor/casualties. Historical policy-v1, initial/enemy aggregate, vehicle, and
   multi-root garrisons remain legacy.
10. Runtime-prove Schema 55 officer, Schema 56 traitor, and Schema 57 spec-ops
    guards without conflating their contracts: only newly started matching
    missions use versions `1`/`2`/`3`. Their route-less rosters keep HVT
    authority separate, preserve exact survivors/casualties through
    materialize-fold-re-entry, settle typed outcomes with zero refund, accept
    compact restore, project status through existing HVT rows, and never enter
    virtual combat. For spec-ops, prove `-57` conflict quarantine and confirm
    ordinary `mission_group_*` rows never become claimants. Prove native
    entities/adapter casualties, actual save/restart, rendered UI, owner-change,
    setup, packaged networking, reconnect, and JIP. Historical/pre-opt-in guards
    and every unsupported family remain contract `0`.
11. Continue with one explicitly versioned mission-force consumer at a time.
    Schema 57 exhausts assassination guards and Schema 58 implements the first
    rescue vertical for newly started `rescue_pows`. Runtime-prove that slice
    before selecting the next consumer; every other unsupported mission family
    remains legacy until its own cutover. Keep
    ownership/town politics, civilian behavior, progression, balance, and
    packaged multiplayer/restart/long-soak certification on separate dependency
    tracks; a later source slice does not certify earlier behavior.

## Game-Mode Target

The player fantasy is FIA resistance on Everon with almost nothing. The US
occupying force owns towns, outposts, resources, factories, ports, and airfields.
The USSR invading force owns or contests selected zones. Players loot, recruit,
train, complete missions, capture zones, build support, and gradually turn the
island against the occupier.

Campaign pacing target:

- Early game: scavenge weapons, use civilian cover, ambush patrols, loot bodies,
  and avoid direct fights.
- Mid game: complete missions, capture weak outposts, build garrisons, garage
  captured vehicles, and improve training.
- Late game: coordinate squads, defend against counterattacks, attack airfields
  and ports, respond to QRFs, and push toward full-map victory.

## Strategic Map Model

Zones are economic, military, mission-generation, and victory nodes. Every
strategic zone should eventually carry:

- `zoneId`
- `displayName`
- `type`
- `ownerFactionKey`
- `position`
- `captureRadius`
- `activationRadius`
- `incomeValue`
- `priority`
- `support`
- `resistanceCaptureProgress`
- `garrisonSlots`
- `compositionId`
- `spawnProfileId`
- `patrolRouteId`
- `qrfRouteId`
- `missionSiteId`
- `linkedZoneIds`

`HST_ZoneState` already contains most of this model. Future work should refine
the existing record instead of creating a parallel strategic map.

## Town Model

Towns should not flip just because soldiers die nearby. Town control should be
driven by support and civilian conditions.

Town ownership inputs:

- resistance support
- occupier support
- civilian population
- civilian casualties by faction
- wanted heat
- police presence
- roadblock presence
- undercover restrictions

Rules:

- Town flips to FIA when FIA support is greater than occupier support.
- Town flips back or becomes hostile when occupier support is greater than FIA
  support.
- Civilian deaths and failed support missions reduce FIA support or increase
  wanted heat.
- Supply/city-aid missions increase FIA support.
- Enemy supply convoys can increase occupier support if they arrive.

`HST_CivilianZoneState` already has the first usable fields: reputation, wanted
heat, civilian presence, police presence, roadblock presence, last incident, and
undercover restriction.

## Progression Model

h-istasi should use these progression axes as campaign-facing state:

- HR: recruitment capacity.
- Faction money: commander spending, training, vehicles, and support.
- Personal money: player rewards, transfers, and personal buys.
- Training level: FIA AI quality and equipment quality.
- War level: enemy/friendly equipment tier and mission difficulty.
- Aggression: enemy response budget, QRF chance, Petros attacks, and roadblocks.
- Town support: town ownership, HR income, and mission availability.
- HQ knowledge: chance/frequency of defend-Petros attacks.
- Arsenal unlocks: resistance equipment modernization.
- Garage inventory: captured vehicle progression.

## Standing Rules

- `HST_CampaignState` is the persistent source of truth.
- Campaign mutations must be server-authoritative.
- Persistent campaign state must not store raw `IEntity` references.
- Off-screen forces stay abstract.
- Physical AI activates around players, active objectives, QRFs, convoys, and
  important mission runtime.
- Every new feature needs a debug/report path in the command menu or logs.
- Every feature must be testable in `HST_Dev` before Everon polish.
- Do not add hidden addon dependencies or non-base-game asset assumptions.
- If a Reforger API call is unavailable or fragile, fail with a clear reason
  and preserve campaign state.

## Architectural Principles

### Server-Authoritative Campaign State

All campaign changes go through server-side services. Client UI sends requests;
the server validates phase, permissions, player identity, target IDs, distances,
costs, mission state, and cooldowns.

Never let a client directly mutate:

- money
- HR
- arsenal counts
- garage records
- mission success/failure
- zone ownership
- garrisons
- support requests
- enemy orders
- undercover state

### Abstract First, Physical Second

For every system, define abstract campaign state before physical implementation.

Example:

- Abstract: garrison at an outpost has eight infantry and one vehicle.
- Physical: when players enter activation radius, spawn a group and vehicle.
- Fold-back: when players leave, count survivors and fold them back into the
  garrison.

`HST_PhysicalWarService` already follows this shape for zone activation and
survivor fold-back. New features should keep using this pattern.

### Physical Entities Are Disposable

Every spawned entity should have a state record that can survive the entity
being deleted or the server restarting:

- runtime entity ID
- mission instance ID, zone ID, or group ID
- prefab
- position
- angles
- spawned flag
- destroyed/recovered/deleted flags

If the server restarts, h-istasi should recreate, abstract, or safely discard
physical projections based on persistent state. It must not rely on raw entity
handles as truth.

### Deterministic Generation

Generated sites, routes, mission targets, convoy starts, and support spawn
points should come from stable inputs:

- campaign seed
- zone ID
- mission ID
- elapsed-second bucket
- war level
- faction key

Avoid pure random calls that cannot be reproduced or diagnosed after restart.

### Small Vertical Slices

Every implementation task should be shippable and testable in `HST_Dev` before
Everon polish. A good phase slice defines:

- goal
- files to inspect
- files likely to modify
- state fields changed
- server methods added
- UI/debug command added
- acceptance tests
- do-not-change constraints

## Service Ownership Map

### Coordinator

File: `Scripts/Game/HST/Components/HST_CampaignCoordinatorComponent.c`

Responsibilities:

- create services
- restore/create campaign state
- apply settings
- register players
- tick campaign services
- route UI/RPC commands
- broadcast mission/support/order/capture events
- refresh markers
- trigger persistence checkpoints

Rules:

- Keep coordinator thin.
- Do not put domain logic directly in coordinator.
- Add services for new domains.
- Add coordinator methods only as authenticated server entry points.
- Every coordinator command should return a human-readable result string and
  optionally emit a feed/event entry.

Baseline acceptance:

- Server starts `HST_Dev`.
- Coordinator initializes once.
- State schema version is current.
- Menu opens.
- Manual save works or reports a clear not-available reason.
- Mission start command works.
- No service throws null-state errors during a short idle smoke pass.

### Campaign State

File: `Scripts/Game/HST/State/HST_CampaignState.c`

Persistent state should remain the only durable truth. Future fields should fall
into one of three patterns.

Durable campaign facts:

- zone owner
- town support
- arsenal item count
- garage vehicle record
- player membership
- HQ position
- Petros alive/dead

Active runtime records:

- active mission
- active group
- support request
- enemy order
- convoy runtime
- runtime vehicle
- mission asset

Transient diagnostics:

- last spawn failure
- last vehicle target reason
- last UI result
- last mission runtime event

Acceptance pattern:

- Start campaign.
- Start mission.
- Spawn runtime assets.
- Save.
- Restart.
- Verify mission, assets, markers, resources, HQ, and players restore.
- Complete mission.
- Save again.
- Restart.
- Verify completed mission is not physically respawned.

| 24 | Balance, campaign pacing, and victory/loss | In progress - population outcome default |
| 25 | Full-campaign soak testing | Planned |

## Roadmap Sequencing Rationale

The roadmap is ordered so each phase increases confidence before increasing
complexity. Phases 0-2 establish the diagnostic foundation: campaign health,
mission runtime state, and convoy internals are visible before movement,
persistence, and player-facing polish are expanded.

Phases 3-12 focus on convoy, mission, and persistence hardening because convoy
runtime crosses the highest-risk boundaries first: generated sites, routes,
spawned assets, active groups, AI behavior, mission cleanup, and save/load
restore. Getting that slice stable gives the rest of the campaign a repeatable
pattern for runtime projections of persistent state.

Phases 13-19 broaden the campaign loop into additional mission families,
commander behavior, physical war activation, zone capture, garrisons, and
support/QRF systems. Phases 20-24 then deepen the player-facing resistance
systems: civilians, undercover rules, economy, HQ logistics, UI, and balance.
Phase 25 is deliberately a hardening and soak phase rather than a feature phase;
it exists to prove the whole system can survive long server sessions and
save/load cycles.

## System Roadmap

These system notes are cross-cutting guidance for the phase list. They describe
where each major campaign subsystem is headed and what a future phase should
protect while implementing it.

### Setup And Campaign Phase

Purpose: start in setup, let the commander choose HQ, then move to active
campaign play.

Required behavior:

- `CAMPAIGN_SETUP`: allow admin/commander to select initial hideout; block
  missions, income, enemy commander, and capture.
- `CAMPAIGN_ACTIVE`: allow missions, income, enemy orders, support, capture,
  HQ movement, and checkpoints.
- `CAMPAIGN_ENDED`: freeze campaign mutation and show victory/loss state.

Future hardening:

- Add a central `CanMutateCampaign(actionId)` helper.
- Reject mission/economy/enemy/capture actions during setup.
- Add command-menu status explaining blocked actions.
- Add dev report for phase and HQ state.

Acceptance:

- Starting a mission before HQ selection returns a clear failure.
- Selecting HQ deploys Petros/cache/arsenal/tent/spawn-point.
- Moving HQ updates all HQ runtime positions.
- Save/load preserves selected HQ.

### Persistence And Schema Migration

Purpose: make the war survive restarts.

Persist:

- campaign metadata
- phase
- elapsed seconds
- resources
- players
- HQ
- zones
- garrisons
- active groups
- missions
- mission assets
- runtime vehicles
- arsenal
- garage
- support requests
- enemy orders
- civilian state
- undercover state
- generated sites/routes
- tasks

Do not persist as required truth:

- raw `IEntity` pointers
- `AIGroup` pointers
- spawned entity object handles
- temporary UI selection
- unsynchronized client-only data

Future smoke tools:

- `persistence_smoke_prepare`: creates test arsenal item, garage vehicle, active
  mission, mission asset, and active group, then forces checkpoint.
- `persistence_smoke_verify`: verifies restored records and reports missing
  categories separately.

Acceptance:

- Run prepare, save, restart, verify.
- Verification reports each category separately.

### Map Zones, Sites, And Routes

Purpose: drive income, missions, enemy orders, garrisons, QRFs, convoy routes,
town support, and victory.

Required zone types:

- town
- outpost
- resource
- factory
- radio tower
- airfield
- seaport
- bank
- police station
- roadblock
- support/stash/crash site
- HQ hideout

Required generated content:

- primary objective position
- secondary objective position
- roadblock/convoy ambush point
- support/cache point
- civilian stash
- crash/salvage point
- patrol route
- QRF route
- convoy route

Route model target:

```c
class HST_RouteWaypointState
{
	string m_sRouteId;
	int m_iIndex;
	vector m_vPosition;
	int m_iRadiusMeters;
	string m_sHint; // road, junction, bridge, destination, fallback
}

class HST_GeneratedRouteState
{
	string m_sRouteId;
	string m_sSourceZoneId;
	string m_sTargetZoneId;
	vector m_vStartPosition;
	vector m_vEndPosition;
	int m_iDistanceMeters;
	bool m_bRoadRoute;
	bool m_bValidatedForVehicles;
	ref array<ref HST_RouteWaypointState> m_aWaypoints;
}
```

Acceptance:

- Generated content report shows sites and routes.
- Every strategic zone has a primary site.
- Every outpost/resource/town has at least one mission-compatible site.
- Every convoy-capable zone has a vehicle-safe start and destination.
- Generated route positions are dry ground.
- No generated route starts inside HQ safe radius.

### Factions And Templates

Purpose: define units, vehicles, loadouts, equipment tiers, group prefabs,
patrol types, QRF types, support capabilities, and war-level scaling.

Fixed Everon preset:

- FIA: player resistance.
- US: occupying force.
- USSR: invading force.

Target faction contract:

```c
class HST_FactionTemplate
{
	string factionKey;
	string displayName;
	string sideKind; // resistance, occupier, invader
	array<string> infantryGroupPrefabs;
	array<string> patrolGroupPrefabs;
	array<string> qrfGroupPrefabs;
	array<string> vehiclePrefabsByTier;
	array<string> convoyVehiclePrefabsByTier;
	array<string> staticWeaponPrefabs;
	array<string> civilianVehiclePrefabs;
	array<string> startingRebelItemPrefabs;
	array<string> lootBlacklistPrefabs;
	array<string> unlockBlockedPrefabs;
	bool supportsHelicopter;
	bool supportsArmor;
	bool supportsArtillery;
	bool supportsAirstrike;
}
```

Slices:

- Keep base US/USSR/FIA templates and validate every prefab on server start.
- Add war-level equipment tier selection.
- Have mission runtime and physical war ask faction templates for composition.
- Add faction capability flags.
- Disable unsupported support calls and mission families honestly.
- Add future mod preset extension points without hidden dependencies.

Acceptance:

- Faction report lists valid group prefabs and vehicle prefabs.
- Invalid prefab is logged once and skipped.
- War level changes selected vehicle tier.
- Convoy vehicle selection never returns empty when convoy mission is enabled.

### Economy, HR, War Level, And Aggression

Purpose: pace the campaign.

Income tick:

- FIA towns generate HR and money.
- FIA resources generate money.
- FIA factories modify resource income.
- FIA seaports modify HR/vehicle availability.
- Enemy zones generate enemy attack/support resources.

War level increases from:

- captured territory
- captured high-value zones
- optional elapsed time
- optional successful missions

War level affects:

- enemy equipment tier
- convoy composition
- QRF strength
- mission difficulty
- support response type

Aggression increases from:

- killing enemies
- completing hostile missions
- taking flags
- destroying assets
- shooting civilians or prisoners
- capturing zones

Aggression decreases from:

- time decay
- failed rebel actions
- possibly aid/support actions

Aggression affects:

- QRF chance
- roadblocks
- patrol density
- Petros attack chance
- support calls
- enemy resource spending priorities

Future report:

- `BuildEconomyBreakdown(state)` showing income sources by zone type, enemy
  resource income by faction, and aggression decay timer.

### HQ, Petros, Members, Guests, And Commander

Purpose: define the resistance hub and permissions.

Required HQ objects:

- Petros
- arsenal/cache
- garage/vehicle box
- tent/rest point
- map/whiteboard
- flag/recruitment point
- optional build box

Petros behavior:

- Petros alive: missions and HQ actions are available.
- Petros killed: apply HR/money penalty, fail defend-Petros mission, increase
  HQ pressure, and enter recovery/campaign-loss flow depending final design.

Authorization shape:

- Admin: reset, force save, debug, membership management.
- Commander: spend faction money, move HQ, train troops, recruit squads, manage
  garrisons, request support, start missions, manage roadblocks/watchposts.
- Member: request missions, recruit personal squad, use arsenal within limits,
  garage vehicles if allowed, loot/deposit.
- Guest: limited access and no limited arsenal items unless policy allows.

Future hardening:

- `CanUseAction(playerId, actionId)`.
- Action category: admin, commander, member, guest.
- UI disabled reason instead of hiding all blocked actions.
- Membership report.

### Arsenal, Looting, Loadouts, And Unlocks

Purpose: complete the loot-to-unlock resistance progression loop.

Current direction:

- `HST_ArsenalService` owns deposits, counts, unlock thresholds, finite items,
  infinite unlocked items, and issued-item accounting.
- `HST_LootService` scans nearby entities, collects eligible inventory/loose
  items, skips blocked/friendly/player-owned items, and captures vehicles into
  garage records.

Target behavior:

- Area loot deposits eligible items into campaign arsenal.
- Vehicle loot transfers eligible cargo into nearby vehicle cargo.
- Vehicle cargo can transfer to arsenal.
- Arsenal counts finite items.
- Items unlock when threshold is reached.
- Unlocked items become infinite.
- Blocked items never unlock or never deposit depending config.
- Loadout editor validates costs before applying.
- Failed loadout application is atomic and does not lose items.
- AI recruit loadouts can eventually draw from unlocked arsenal tiers.

Acceptance:

- Depositing an item increases arsenal count.
- Item unlocks at configured threshold.
- Withdrawing finite item decrements count.
- Withdrawing unlocked item does not decrement count.
- Blocked item does not unlock.
- Loadout apply is atomic.
- Save/load preserves arsenal counts and unlock state.

### Garage And Vehicle Persistence

Purpose: make captured vehicles part of campaign progression.

Target behavior:

- Capture nearby vehicle into garage.
- Validate vehicle root and reject parts/proxies/scenery.
- Validate vehicle is not occupied.
- Capture physical and virtual cargo.
- Delete physical vehicle only after garage record is prepared.
- Redeploy vehicle near HQ at a safe slot.
- Restore cargo on redeploy.
- Track ammo/repair/fuel source vehicles.

Acceptance:

- Captured vehicle appears in garage report.
- Captured vehicle despawns from world.
- Vehicle cargo is preserved.
- Redeployed vehicle spawns at safe HQ position.
- Garage record is removed or updated according to redeploy policy.
- Ammo truck is recognized as ammo source.
- Save/load preserves garage vehicles and cargo.

### Mission Runtime

Purpose: make mission starts, objectives, runtime entities, cleanup, and
save/load deterministic.

Mission lifecycle:

- select eligible mission
- select target zone/site
- create active mission record
- create objective records
- initialize runtime primitive
- create mission assets/runtime entity records
- activate physical projection only when appropriate
- update objective progress
- complete/fail/expire with clear reason
- clean up disposable physical entities
- preserve durable campaign effects

Mission primitive targets:

- `kill_hvt`
- `hold_area`
- `clear_area`
- `destroy_target`
- `recover_cargo`
- `rescue_extract`
- `deliver_supplies`
- `convoy_intercept`
- `defend_petros`

Acceptance:

- Every active mission has an inspectable runtime report.
- Objective links are stable and visible.
- Missing target/site/entity data reports `none` or `missing:<id>`.
- Runtime cleanup does not erase durable rewards/penalties.
- Active missions survive save/load.

### Convoys

Purpose: make convoy missions a long-lived physical/abstract hybrid that can be
ambushed, tracked, saved, and resolved.

Generic convoy model:

- active mission owns convoy objective and mission assets
- each vehicle asset has source/current/target positions
- each active convoy group has faction, group prefab, crew count, vehicle state,
  fallback mode, spawn failure reason, and runtime status
- route state provides ordered waypoints
- readiness gate decides whether movement can begin
- vehicle-control adapter owns seating, driver, gunner, mobility, and route
  assignment checks
- progress tracker owns stuck detection and destination arrival
- contact detector owns ambush/contact phase transitions
- mission-specific hooks apply unique rewards/penalties

Schema-52 exact convoy cutover:

- only a newly started convoy mission receives operation contract version `1`;
  restored historical convoy rows remain contract version `0`
- admission freezes one generated road route, exactly three vehicle slots,
  three linked crew groups and ordered members, and mission-kind-compatible
  cargo/captive on vehicle zero; invalid cardinality, role/kind, or entity
  prefab fails admission
- one durable convoy element owns each vehicle/crew pair across virtual,
  materializing, physical, folded, restored, and settled states
- off-screen travel advances the persisted route cursor; off-screen combat is
  not yet simulated
- near players, the PhysicalWar convoy adapter projects the exact surviving
  elements; a clear convoy folds outside the larger radius without applying a
  casualty or outcome; outbound publication is atomic across every vehicle,
  group, mapped member, and cargo participant
- route-authoritative arrival and durable zero-crew completion feed the existing
  once-only mission-specific outcome owner before operation settlement
- crew elimination with unresolved cargo/captive/vehicle recovery enters an
  on-station recovery hold that may fold/rematerialize until the required
  mission-specific outcome is resolved

Mission-specific convoy targets:

- `convoy_ammo`: captured ammo vehicle creates ammo-source effect or ammo reward.
- `convoy_armored`: captured armor can be garaged; composition scales with war
  level.
- `convoy_money`: full payout requires money vehicle/cargo delivered to HQ.
- `convoy_prisoners`: prisoners must be freed/extracted for full reward.
- `convoy_reinforcements`: arrival strengthens target garrison.
- `convoy_supplies`: arrival increases occupier support; captured/delivered
  supplies increase FIA support.

Convoy persistence:

- Save mission state, phase, route ID, route waypoints, vehicle assets, current
  positions, crew group states, runtime vehicle states, ETA, objective progress,
  and destroyed/captured/delivered flags.
- On load, do not assume physical entities still exist.
- If players are near, respawn physical vehicles/crew at saved positions and
  reassign route from nearest waypoint.
- If players are far, keep convoy abstract and advance/resolve by state.

### Support Requests

Purpose: represent FIA and enemy support as stateful, testable requests.

FIA support targets:

- supply support
- ground reinforcement
- mortar support only if an honest asset path exists
- vehicle delivery
- optional extraction later

Enemy support targets:

- QRF
- patrol/search
- ground reinforcement
- abstract helicopter-style support when no safe asset path exists
- artillery only if honest asset path exists

Request contract:

- validates cost
- validates cooldown
- records source and target
- has ETA and status
- physicalizes near players
- resolves abstractly when off-screen

Acceptance:

- FIA support request appears in support report.
- Enemy support request spends enemy resources.
- Request has ETA and status.
- Request resolves physically when players are nearby.
- Legacy requests may resolve abstractly when players are far; an exact paid
  infantry QRF instead remains virtual and continues its operation.
- Cooldown prevents spam.
- Save/load preserves active support requests.

### UI, Map Markers, And Player Feedback

Purpose: make the campaign understandable without reading logs.

Current command menu tabs:

- Setup
- Overview
- HQ/Petros
- Missions
- Map/War
- Forces
- Arsenal/Loot
- Members
- Admin

Target UI panels:

- Overview: resources, HR, war level, aggression, support, active missions.
- HQ/Petros: HQ status, Petros health, move HQ, train troops, save.
- Missions: available missions, active missions, objective progress, runtime
  report, admin abandon/fail debug.
- Map/War: zones by owner, garrison strength, town support, enemy orders,
  QRF/support status.
- Forces: FIA garrisons, active groups, recruitment, training.
- Arsenal/Loot: loot nearby, loot to vehicle, arsenal report, loadout editor,
  garage report, capture/redeploy vehicle.
- Members: commander, members, guests, permissions.
- Admin: reset, save, debug resources, force mission, spawn test convoy,
  persistence smoke tests.

Marker targets:

- active mission marker
- objective marker
- convoy start marker, if useful and not too revealing
- convoy last-known marker
- convoy destination marker, possibly approximate
- QRF/support inbound marker
- capture progress marker
- zone ownership marker
- HQ visibility rules

## Testing And Validation Strategy

### Static And Compile Gates

- PowerShell foundation validation script.
- Resource path validation.
- Missing prefab report.
- Enum/string constant validation.
- State schema migration validation.
- No hidden dependency checks.

### Service Smoke Tests

In Reforger scripting these are usually dev commands or smoke services:

- economy tick test
- arsenal deposit/unlock/withdraw test
- garage capture/redeploy test
- mission start/complete/fail test
- route generation test
- convoy spawn test
- persistence prepare/verify test

### HST_Dev Scenario Tests

- Start campaign.
- Select HQ.
- Start each mission family.
- Spawn each runtime primitive.
- Complete/fail by interaction.
- Save/load.
- Repeat as local host.

### Full Everon Soak

- Two-hour idle with no players moving.
- Two-hour mission loop.
- Multi-client join/leave test.
- Save/restart under active mission.
- Active convoy save/restart.
- Zone capture/counterattack loop.

### Convoy-Specific Test Matrix

Route generation:

- valid route
- no route
- route too short
- route near HQ
- wet/water route

Spawn:

- three or more vehicles spawn
- one vehicle fails
- crew group fails
- no driver assigned
- invalid vehicle prefab

Movement:

- staging to moving
- waypoint assignment success
- waypoint assignment failure to static ambush/contact
- moving marker update
- stuck detection
- destination arrival

Combat:

- player approaches and contact starts
- kill one crew group and progress becomes 1/N
- kill all crews and objective succeeds
- destroy cargo vehicle and branch mission-specific result
- capture vehicle with living crew is blocked
- capture after crew eliminated is allowed

Persistence:

- save in staging
- save while moving
- save after contact
- save after one vehicle destroyed
- save after success before cleanup

- Add `BuildConvoyRuntimeReport(state, mission)`.
- Report mission instance ID, mission ID, phase, ETA, source position, target
  position, route/site ID, vehicle asset count, and mission failure reason.
- Report each convoy vehicle asset: asset ID, prefab, source position, current
  position, target position, spawned, destroyed, delivered/captured, and last
  interaction.
- Report each active convoy group: group ID, faction, prefab, spawned entity,
  runtime status, crew count, alive crew count, source position, target
  position, fallback mode, and spawn failure reason.
- Add Missions tab action `Convoy Runtime Report`.
- Add route/travel distance visibility and explicit static fallback when
  vehicle control is unavailable.

Acceptance criteria:

- Starting `convoy_ammo` in `HST_Dev` creates a convoy report.
- Convoy report lists all convoy vehicle assets.
- Convoy report lists all active convoy groups.
- Report shows whether each vehicle/group spawned.
- Report shows alive crew count.
- Report shows why movement or spawn failed.
- Report remains valid after convoy fails or completes.

Notes carried into Phase 3:

- Verified ground vehicle variety now uses live faction campaign entity
  catalogs first, then GUID-qualified base-game fallback resources.
- Real AI vehicle embark/movement is not implemented yet; convoy reports now
  expose this as a clear static-ambush fallback reason.

## Phase 3 - Convoy Route State

Status: Complete

Implementation/static validation complete. HST_Dev smoke test confirmed route
waypoint reporting, generated-route diagnostics, faction-catalog vehicle
variety, and clean convoy staging without resource-error spam.

Goal: move from start/end-only convoy behavior toward explicit route data.

Implementation:

- Add `HST_RouteWaypointState`.
- Extend `HST_GeneratedRouteState` with an ordered route waypoint array.
- Generate at least start, midpoint, and destination waypoints.
- Add route validation fields: road route, vehicle-safe, distance meters, and
  waypoint count.
- Add route reporting to generated content reports and convoy reports.
- Read base-game faction campaign entity catalogs for convoy vehicle
  candidates, then validate wheeled/tracked ground vehicles and exclude
  helicopters/aircraft.

Suggested state:

```c
[BaseContainerProps()]
class HST_RouteWaypointState
{
	string m_sRouteId;
	int m_iIndex;
	vector m_vPosition;
	int m_iRadiusMeters;
	string m_sHint;
}
```

Acceptance criteria:

- Generated content creates route waypoints.
- Every generated route has at least three waypoints.
- Convoy mission references a route or produces a clear fallback reason.
- Route report shows waypoint count and distance.
- Invalid route does not crash mission start.
- Convoy vehicle selection uses verified faction-catalog ground vehicle prefabs
  first, with GUID-qualified fallback prefabs only when the catalog is
  unavailable or sparse.
- Invalid or guessed vehicle prefab candidates are removed or skipped without
  resource errors.
- Ground-vehicle candidate report shows usable convoy vehicle counts per
  faction.

## Phase 4 - Convoy Readiness Gating

Status: Complete

Implementation/static validation and HST_Dev smoke testing complete.

Goal: prevent convoys from entering `convoy_moving` unless they are actually
ready to move.

Implementation:

- Separate vehicle asset exists, physical vehicle spawned, crew group spawned,
  crew alive, driver available, and waypoint/route assigned.
- Add readiness check before staging changes to moving.
- Remain staging while within grace period.
- Fall back to convoy contact/static ambush or fail with explicit reason after
  grace period.
- Add readiness status to convoy report.

Acceptance criteria:

- Convoy does not enter moving phase if no vehicles spawned.
- Convoy does not enter moving phase if crew groups failed.
- Convoy does not enter moving phase if route/waypoint assignment failed.
- Failure or fallback reason is visible in convoy report.
- Existing static fallback still lets players complete/fail the mission.
- Readiness report separates vehicle assets, spawned vehicles, crew groups,
  alive crew, driver availability, route assignment, and waypoint assignment.
- Convoy moving notifications, markers, and status changes are emitted only
  after readiness succeeds.

## Phase 5 - Convoy Vehicle-Control Adapter

Status: Complete

Goal: isolate Reforger vehicle seating, driver, gunner, and route-control logic
behind one adapter.

Implementation:

- Create `HST_ConvoyVehicleControlAdapter`.
- Add methods to bind crew, assign a vehicle route, count living crew, check
  for a living driver, and check whether a vehicle is mobile.
- Return explicit success/failure reasons from every method.
- Make `HST_PhysicalWarService` call the adapter instead of assuming
  `AddWaypoint` means the vehicle can move.

Suggested interface:

```c
class HST_ConvoyVehicleControlAdapter
{
	bool TryBindCrewToVehicle(
		HST_ActiveGroupState groupState,
		IEntity groupEntity,
		IEntity vehicleEntity,
		out string reason
	);

	bool TryAssignVehicleRoute(
		HST_ActiveGroupState groupState,
		IEntity groupEntity,
		IEntity vehicleEntity,
		array<vector> waypoints,
		out int assignedWaypointCount,
		out string reason
	);

	int CountLivingCrew(IEntity groupEntity);

	bool HasLivingDriver(IEntity groupEntity, IEntity vehicleEntity);

	bool IsVehicleMobile(IEntity vehicleEntity, out string reason);
}
```

Acceptance criteria:

- Project compiles with the new adapter.
- Convoy logic calls the adapter.
- Convoy report shows adapter result.
- Existing convoy behavior is preserved or fails with clearer reasons.
- No raw `IEntity` references are added to persistent state.

## Phase 6 - Real Convoy Crew Seating

Status: In progress - current production repair is compile-proven; fresh scoped runtime proof pending.

The older implementation/static smoke did not survive the later dedicated
runtime artifact: all three populated crews remained driverless through the
grace window. Current source repairs the ordering and authority path, but this
phase is not complete again until the scoped convoy proof passes.

Goal: make convoy vehicles actually controllable by AI.

Implementation:

- In `HST_ConvoyVehicleControlAdapter`, discover living group-controlled AI
  agents and vehicle compartments.
- Register each valid pilotable vehicle with the crew-group utility before any
  seating request, and verify retained registration directly.
- Assign the first suitable server-owned AI to the driver seat through forced
  authority-local compartment entry, with the owner RPC as fallback after a
  direct rejection or for a non-local entity.
- Assign the next suitable AI to gunner/turret seats if available.
- Assign remaining AI to cargo/passenger seats.
- Verify the driver is a living group-controlled occupant in a pilot slot.
- Add seating result fields to convoy reports: driver assigned, seated crew,
  turret seated, cargo seated, seating pending, and last seating reason.
- Retry seating during convoy staging before readiness checks.
- Keep convoy waypoint assignment blocked until every active convoy vehicle has
  a seated living AI driver.
- Enforce convoy start-to-end straight-line horizontal distance between 2000m
  and 5000m, and report planned distance, band validity, and whether generated
  route staging is vehicle-safe.

Acceptance criteria:

- Spawned convoy vehicle has an AI driver.
- Convoy report says driver assigned.
- Convoy report says how many crew were seated.
- Convoy report says planned distance is inside the 2000-5000m band.
- Convoy report says planned source/target are route-staged and vehicle-safe.
- Missing driver seats and missing crew agents produce clear reasons.
- Vehicle is not considered ready unless driver assignment succeeds.
- No persistent raw `IEntity` references or save-schema migrations are added.

## Phase 7 - Convoy Waypoint-Chain Movement

Status: In progress - implemented; fresh live waypoint-chain proof pending after seating repair.

The waypoint-chain implementation and static contracts exist, but the latest
driverless convoy artifact prevented a valid live chain. Fresh proof resumes
only after Phase 6 confirms every vehicle has a living pilot occupant.

Goal: replace single destination waypoint with an ordered route waypoint chain.

Implementation:

- Build an ordered `array<vector>` from route waypoints.
- Spawn an AI waypoint for each route point.
- Add waypoints to the convoy AI group in order.
- Optionally stagger departure by vehicle index.
- Store assigned waypoint count in `HST_ActiveGroupState.m_iAssignedWaypointCount`
  and report.
- Keep old single-waypoint path only as fallback.

Acceptance criteria:

- Convoy report shows assigned waypoint count.
- Waypoint count is greater than one for generated routes.
- Convoy enters moving phase only after waypoint-chain assignment succeeds.
- If waypoint spawning fails, convoy falls back to static ambush/contact with a
  clear reason.
- Vehicles attempt to travel toward the destination.

## Phase 8 - Convoy Progress, Stuck Detection, And Destination Arrival

Status: In progress - schema-52 route/projection/fold authority is implemented
and source-validated; natural physical progress/intercept/fold/arrival proof is
pending.

For newly started schema-52 convoys, the persisted generated-route cursor now
replaces the travel timer as strategic movement authority. The exact operation
advances virtually at 9 m/s, materializes inside 1,800 m, folds outside 2,200 m
only when clear after its minimum physical window, preserves per-element state
and crew casualties, and requires two distinct physical route-end samples
within 50 m. Historical convoy rows keep the legacy behavior described below.

Implementation/static validation target: Phase 8 now tracks transient convoy
progress in `HST_PhysicalWarService` without adding campaign save fields. A
smoke-test follow-up makes destination arrival win over single-group dismount
recovery, keeps convoy starts compact and vehicle-safe without shortening the
2000-5000m convoy trip, narrows arrival to 50 meters, and uses
RoadNetworkManager-resolved road endpoints, waypoints, and recovery snaps.
HST_Dev smoke testing passed for road-based spawning, movement, stuck recovery,
arrival failure with living crew, crew-neutralized completion, and inactive
convoy runtime cleanup.

Goal: track whether convoy vehicles are actually moving and respond if they get
stuck.

Implementation:

- Sync convoy vehicle positions every five seconds.
- Track distance to destination per vehicle.
- Track last movement/progress timestamp.
- Detect no-progress/stuck state.
- Reissue route once after a stuck threshold.
- Resolve convoy starts, destinations, assigned waypoint positions, and recovery
  snap points through RoadNetworkManager road geometry instead of terrain
  material or generic safe-ground checks.
- If stuck too long, snap the vehicle only to a nearby road-resolved point when
  the nearest player is at least 300 meters away.
- Keep physical and report the stuck reason when players are too close, no
  road snap point can be resolved, the point is too close to destination, the
  point would advance too far toward destination, or crew
  reseating cannot confirm a driver.
- Move unseated living crew to the recovered vehicle, reseat through the convoy
  vehicle adapter, orient the vehicle along route travel direction, then reissue
  route only after driver recovery succeeds.
- Keep marker refresh at 30 seconds.
- Fail convoy if it reaches destination with living crew.
- Resolve destination arrival before moving convoy dismount/contact fallback.
- Treat a single dismounted or driverless moving convoy group as a bounded
  reseat/rebind recovery issue instead of whole-convoy contact fallback.
- Stage convoy vehicle starts as compact road-resolved columns; destinations
  and all assigned waypoint positions must also be road-resolved.
- Choose a seeded random convoy start distance between 2000m and 5000m each
  time convoy assets are initialized.
- Pre-probe the full convoy vehicle column before creating mission assets; if
  any vehicle slot fails the safe-spawn or distance-band checks, reject that
  candidate and probe another instead of creating a partial convoy.
- Reject convoy spawn slots that are not RoadNetworkManager road points wide
  enough for vehicle footprint samples; terrain height/footprint checks remain
  secondary stability checks only.
- Re-check road placement during physical vehicle spawn and route-snap recovery,
  and use a smaller spawn lift to avoid dropping trucks onto uneven terrain.
- Preserve the existing 2000-5000m convoy travel-distance contract for every
  planned convoy vehicle slot.
- Keep convoy vehicle start slots in a compact route-column formation instead
  of scattering them through wide spawn-clearance searches.
- Wait for a reseated driver before consuming a route reissue attempt.
- Show live computed distance-to-destination in the convoy report, with sampled
  progress distance retained as a diagnostic.

Acceptance criteria:

- Moving convoy updates mission asset current positions.
- Convoy marker updates periodically.
- Convoy report shows distance to destination.
- Convoy report shows stuck/no-progress status.
- Convoy report shows RoadNetworkManager availability and road-resolved source,
  current, target, waypoint, and recovery placement results.
- Route is not reissued every tick.
- Convoy fails if destination is reached with living crew.
- Convoy does not falsely fail while still staging.
- A single dismounted convoy group does not immediately switch the mission to
  `convoy_contact`.
- Convoy report shows moving recovery reasons for dismounted or driverless
  groups.
- Convoy arrival failure uses a 50 meter destination radius.
- Convoy planned distance remains inside the 2000-5000m band for the convoy
  column, not only the first vehicle.
- Convoy setup creates either all planned convoy vehicle assets or none; it
  should not create a mission with later convoy vehicles guaranteed to fail
  physical spawn.
- Convoy pre-probing and physical spawn reject non-road, narrow-road, rocky, or
  uneven large-vehicle footprints instead of allowing trucks to spawn off-road,
  tipped, or on rocks.
- Convoy report shows route snap attempt/result, distance-to-destination, player
  gate, and crew reseat result.
- Convoy vehicles spawn as a compact column on generated route staging rather
  than hundreds of meters apart.
- Convoy Runtime Report shows the assigned road-snapped runtime waypoint chain
  per convoy group instead of treating static route-template waypoints as the
  authoritative movement path.

HST_Dev smoke steps:

1. Launch `Missions/HST_Dev.conf` in Workbench Play mode.
2. Press `I`, open Setup, and choose `Start HQ: central hills`.
3. Open Admin and run `Force: Ammo convoy`.
4. Open Missions and run `Convoy Runtime Report`.
5. Wait for the convoy to leave staging; verify phase becomes `convoy_moving`,
   waypoint count is greater than one, band valid is `yes`, and
   distance-to-destination appears. Vehicle source/current distances should all
   be inside the 2000-5000m band, and the vehicles should be a compact route
   column on roads, not scattered hundreds of meters apart, upside down, or
   sitting on visible rocks/steep side-tilt terrain.
6. Watch the map for convoy marker movement; it should refresh periodically,
   about every 30 seconds.
7. For unstuck testing, block a convoy vehicle or let terrain stop it, then
   move the player at least 300 meters away. After the hard-stuck window, the
   report should show route reissue, then route snap to a nearby road-resolved
   point, distance-to-destination for the snap point, road forward/orientation,
   and crew reseat result.
8. If one crew group dismounts, run `Convoy Runtime Report`; the mission should
   remain `convoy_moving` unless every moving group has lost control, and the
   report should show moving recovery status.
9. For arrival testing, do not kill the crew. When the convoy reaches
   within 50 meters of the destination with living crew, the mission should
   fail with `Convoy reached its destination with living crew.`
10. Repeat once with crew killed before arrival; the convoy should not falsely
   fail due to destination arrival after crew neutralization.

## Phase 9 - Convoy Contact Behavior

Status: Complete

Implementation/static validation: Phase 9 adds a 120 meter convoy contact
radius and transitions active convoy missions into `convoy_contact` when the
ambush starts. Contact is stored through existing active mission phase state and
does not add campaign schema fields. Static validation passed, and HST_Dev
smoke testing confirmed proximity contact without contact-only completion.

Goal: make ambushes transition convoys into a combat/contact state.

Implementation:

- Detect contact when a player is within 120 meters, crew count decreases,
  convoy vehicle is destroyed, vehicle is captured, or later when
  shots/explosions are nearby.
- Set mission phase to `convoy_contact`.
- Apply `convoy_contact` status to active convoy groups.
- Keep the objective active.
- Do not instantly fail or complete just because contact started.
- Preserve `convoy_contact` when generic mission vehicle destroy/capture
  handlers update convoy vehicle assets.
- Show contact radius and contact reason in the convoy runtime report.

Acceptance criteria:

- Approaching convoy changes phase to `convoy_contact`.
- Killing convoy crew changes objective progress.
- Destroying a convoy vehicle updates asset/runtime state.
- Convoy can still complete after contact.
- Contact phase survives save/load.

HST_Dev smoke steps:

1. Launch `Missions/HST_Dev.conf` in Workbench Play mode.
2. Press `I`, open Setup, and choose `Start HQ: central hills`.
3. Open Admin and run `Force: Ammo convoy`.
4. Open Missions and run `Convoy Runtime Report`; wait until the convoy has
   spawned and preferably reaches `convoy_moving`.
5. Approach within 120 meters of the convoy without killing anyone. Run
   `Convoy Runtime Report` again and verify mission phase is `convoy_contact`,
   convoy groups show `convoy_contact`, mission status is still active, and
   objective progress has not completed or failed from contact alone.
6. Kill one convoy crew group. Run the report and verify crew neutralized
   progress updates, the mission remains active/contact, and it does not
   instantly complete unless all required convoy crew groups are neutralized.
7. Destroy one convoy vehicle. Run the report and verify the matching convoy
   vehicle asset shows destroyed/runtime destroyed state while the mission
   remains `convoy_contact`.
8. Try capturing a convoy vehicle while its crew is alive; it should be blocked.
   Neutralize that vehicle's crew, capture it again, and verify the asset shows
   captured/delivered without generic phase `captured` replacing
   `convoy_contact`.
9. Neutralize all convoy crew groups after contact. Verify the convoy can
   progress to `convoy_eliminated` and then complete through the normal mission
   outcome path.
10. While the mission is in `convoy_contact`, run `Manual checkpoint`, restart
   or reload HST_Dev, and verify the active mission still reports
   `convoy_contact`.

## Phase 10 - Generic Convoy Completion

Status: Complete for the legacy path; schema-52 exact completion/settlement is
implemented in source and awaits packaged proof.

Implementation/static validation: Phase 10 makes convoy completion
server-authoritative through crew elimination and destination-arrival checks.
The convoy runtime report now exposes completion eligibility, crew progress,
living crew, and vehicle resolution counts. HST_Dev smoke testing confirmed
crew-gated capture, destroyed/captured vehicle exclusion, generic success on
all crews eliminated, failure on live-crewed arrival, preserved intact vehicles
after crew-elimination success, and failed convoy cleanup. Static validation
passed.

Goal: make generic convoy success/failure reliable before adding
mission-specific rewards.

Implementation:

- For a contract-version-1 convoy, use durable zero living crew across all
  active elements to complete the crew objective; missing runtime handles do
  not count as elimination.
- Keep the exact operation open in an on-station recovery hold when crew
  elimination leaves required cargo, captive, or vehicle recovery unresolved;
  settle only after that outcome or another terminal mission result.
- Suppress legacy timer arrival. Virtual arrival comes from route progress and
  physical arrival requires two distinct route-end samples.

- Count total convoy groups, eliminated convoy groups, and living convoy crew.
- Complete objective when all required convoy crews are eliminated.
- Fail mission when convoy arrives with living crew.
- Allow vehicle capture only after associated crew is neutralized.
- Cleanly mark destroyed/captured convoy vehicles.
- Preserve intact convoy vehicles after crew-elimination success so players can
  optionally capture them; destroyed vehicles and failed/arrived convoys still
  clean up.
- Keep rewards and penalties centralized through the coordinator's normal
  mission success/failure path.
- Report `can complete`, `must fail`, reason, required/eliminated groups,
  living crew, and active/destroyed/captured vehicle counts in Convoy Runtime
  Report.

Acceptance criteria:

- Killing one convoy crew updates progress 1/N.
- Killing all convoy crews completes objective.
- Capturing a vehicle with living crew is blocked.
- Capturing a vehicle after crew is eliminated succeeds.
- Destroyed convoy vehicle is not respawned.
- Intact convoy vehicles remain in-world after crew-elimination success.
- Live-crewed arrival fails the mission and cleans up convoy assets.
- Mission success applies generic reward once.
- Mission failure applies failure penalty once.

## Phase 11 - Mission-Specific Convoy Outcomes

Status: Complete; schema-52 exact operations defer to this once-only outcome
owner before writing terminal settlement.

Goal: make convoy mission types meaningfully different.

Implementation:

- Add outcome hooks: `OnConvoyArrived`, `OnConvoyCrewEliminated`,
  `OnConvoyVehicleCaptured`, `OnConvoyCargoDelivered`, and
  `OnConvoyMissionExpired`.
- `convoy_ammo`: ammo truck capture creates an ammo source or ammo reward.
- `convoy_armored`: captured armor can be garaged; composition scales with war
  level.
- `convoy_money`: full payout requires money vehicle/cargo delivered to HQ.
- `convoy_prisoners`: prisoners/captive asset must be freed/extracted for full
  reward.
- `convoy_reinforcements`: arrival strengthens the target garrison.
- `convoy_supplies`: arrival increases occupier support; captured/delivered
  supplies increase FIA support.

Acceptance criteria:

- Reinforcements convoy arrival increases target garrison.
- Supplies convoy arrival increases occupier town support.
- Captured supplies delivered to town increases FIA support.
- Ammo truck capture creates an ammo-source effect or visible garage/source
  flag.
- Money convoy does not grant full payout unless delivered.
- Prisoner convoy can grant HR/support when prisoners are extracted.

Completion notes:

- Added mission-specific convoy outcome service, save guards, runtime reports,
  mission asset follow-up actions, I-menu guidance, and map marker transitions.
- HST_Dev smoke testing confirmed supply delivery and prisoner extraction
  outcomes; cleanup now preserves neutralized convoy vehicles after delivery so
  players can keep or capture them.
- `tools/validate-foundation.ps1` passes with schema 18.

## Phase 12 - Active Mission Persistence

Status: Complete for persisted mission data; schema-52 exact convoy process-
restart/rematerialization proof remains open.

Goal: make active missions, especially convoys, survive save/load.

Implementation:

- Save active mission fields, objectives, mission assets, runtime entity
  records, active convoy groups, and runtime vehicle records.
- On restore, do not assume physical entities still exist.
- Respawn or abstract active runtime based on player proximity and mission
  phase.
- Add a persistence smoke test for active convoy.

Acceptance criteria:

- Save during convoy staging, restart, convoy remains staging.
- Save during convoy moving, restart, convoy remains active.
- Save during convoy contact, restart, objective progress remains.
- Destroyed convoy vehicles stay destroyed after restart.
- Captured convoy vehicles stay captured/garaged after restart.
- Mission does not duplicate vehicles after restore.
- Active non-convoy mission records preserve objectives, mission assets, and
  final status through save/load.
- Restore path does not duplicate mission runtime entities or active groups.

Current notes:

- A schema-52 exact convoy persists its mission/operation/manifest/held-batch
  links and three convoy elements. Restore clears process-local handles and
  arrival samples, retains generated-route progress, element position/vehicle
  state, cargo assignment, and confirmed crew casualties, and resumes one
  coherent open aggregate virtually. Only member slots may carry casualty
  tombstones, legal lifecycle pairs are enumerated, and missionless exact-looking
  rows remain durable quarantine evidence. Historical convoys remain version `0`.
- Before each real capture, persistence reconciles mapped physical exact-convoy
  members. An open publication transaction or ambiguous mapping defers capture
  before flush/savepoint, retains checkpoint intent, and retries on the bounded
  debounce. Packaged death-between-ticks and deferred-save replay remain open.

- Active mission restore now repairs runtime fields, objective-to-asset links,
  mission asset runtime records, and restored spawned flags without adding a
  new save schema.
- Restored convoy runtime normalizes staging/moving/contact phases, rebuilds
  missing live handles from saved convoy assets/groups, preserves destroyed or
  captured vehicle state, and removes the short restore grace-window dependency.
- Re-review hardening keeps preserved convoy crew counts alive through the
  Workbench zero-agent population window so restored or freshly respawned
  convoy groups do not fail before agents report live.
- Persistence smoke coverage now seeds staging, moving, and contact convoy
  records and reports duplicate mission assets, runtime entities, active
  groups, and runtime vehicles.
- Workbench follow-up: smoke fixtures are diagnostic-only and are skipped by
  map markers, mission runtime ticking, convoy physicalization, mission intel,
  and normal command UI surfaces so seeded smoke state does not appear as live
  campaign content.
- `tools/validate-foundation.ps1` passes with schema 18.
- HST_Dev Workbench smoke passed for active convoy restore across moving/contact:
  destroyed convoy slots remain terminal after restart, survivor groups do not
  respawn in a loop, restored convoy completion applies the FIA reward, and the
  completed convoy no longer falls through into failure.

## Phase 13 - Non-Convoy Mission Primitive Hardening

Status: Complete

Goal: bring other mission types up to the same reliability level as convoys.

Mission primitives:

- `kill_hvt`
- `hold_area`
- `clear_area`
- `destroy_target`
- `recover_cargo`
- `rescue_extract`
- `deliver_supplies`

Implementation:

- Runtime assets spawn reliably.
- Objectives link to correct assets/entities.
- Player interaction validates distance and state.
- Objective completion is deterministic.
- Failure reason is clear.
- Runtime cleanup is safe.
- Save/load restore works.

Acceptance criteria:

- Assassination can be completed by killing/sabotaging HVT.
- Destroy mission completes when target is destroyed.
- Logistics recovery completes on pickup; supply delivery completes on delivery.
- Rescue mission can free and deliver captives.
- Hold/clear mission progresses only when conditions are met.
- All mission types show useful runtime reports.
- All mission types survive save/load.

Current notes:

- Non-convoy primitive polling is now explicit for HVT, hold, clear, destroy,
  cargo recovery, rescue/extract, and supply delivery missions.
- Mission asset initialization is idempotent by role/count, so partial restored
  primitive state can self-repair without duplicating assets.
- Asset-driven objectives continue to progress when matching mission assets
  exist, even if a fallback prop is present.
- Recover-cargo objectives now remain pickup-complete. Restored legacy
  `hq_delivery` objectives for active recover-cargo missions are completed by
  the restore repair pass instead of blocking completion.
- Runtime reports now include asset interaction radius, cargo capacity,
  attached/carrier state, outcome state, and delivery distance.
- Persistence smoke coverage now seeds one active mission for each non-convoy
  primitive.
- Workbench follow-up: primitive smoke fixtures are excluded from ordinary
  mission reports, objective ticking, mission start duplicate gates, and map
  marker publication while remaining visible to the persistence smoke report.
- HST_Dev primitive testing passed well enough to close the phase: HVT kill,
  hold/conquest, clear-area, destroy target, resource cache, POW rescue/follow,
  city supplies, mission action visibility, save/load carrier restore, and
  persistence smoke are all covered by implementation and validation.
- Expired missions now preserve and continue player-bound cargo/POW extraction
  scenes, and expired convoy contact preserves the live firefight while players
  remain inside the render bubble.
- Phase 13's primitive remains complete, but the latest packaged check exposed a
  real duplicate-radio-tower presentation/runtime-authority defect. Current
  schema-50 source retains an existing transmitter instead of spawning a second
  composition tower and lets destroy-target missions borrow that entity without
  generic cleanup deleting it. Publish and test destroy/rebuild behavior before
  treating the correction as closed.
- `tools/validate-foundation.ps1` passes with schema 18.

## Phase 14 - Arsenal, Loot, And Finite/Infinite Unlock Loop

Status: In progress - loadout smoke pending. Arsenal, loot, finite/INF policy,
vehicle cargo, and field-vehicle save/load restore have passed HST_Dev smoke.
The loadout editor implementation is present in code, but the phase remains
open until the end-to-end Workbench path is exercised.

Goal: complete the h-istasi loot-to-unlock progression loop.

Implementation:

- Area loot deposits eligible items into the arsenal.
- Vehicle loot stores eligible items in nearby vehicle cargo.
- Vehicle cargo can transfer to the arsenal.
- Arsenal counts finite items.
- Items unlock when threshold is reached.
- Unlocked items become infinite.
- Blocked items never unlock or never deposit, depending on config.
- Loadout editor validates finite/infinite cost before applying.
- Failed loadout application does not lose items.

Acceptance criteria:

- Depositing an item increases arsenal count.
- Item unlocks at configured threshold.
- Withdrawing a finite item decrements count.
- Withdrawing an unlocked item does not decrement count.
- Blocked item does not unlock.
- Loadout apply is atomic.
- Save/load preserves arsenal counts and unlock state.

Checkpoint notes:

- Arsenal item rules are typed balance config, with blocked and finite-only
  behavior visible in reports.
- Raw visual/support assets are rejected from arsenal and vehicle cargo.
- Area loot, vehicle cargo collection, vehicle unload, and reports have been
  exercised in HST_Dev.
- Nearby Workbench-spawned field vehicles are snapshotted before manual
  checkpoint and restored after save/load as `loot_vehicle` runtime records.
- Loadout editor code now includes live equipment/storage nodes, compatible
  candidates, fixed personal save slots, profile loadout files, finite/INF cost
  validation, atomic apply/rollback, issued-item accounting, death-loss
  handling, and removed external state purging.
- Loadout editor HST_Dev smoke remains before Phase 14 can be marked complete.

## Phase 15 - Garage And Vehicle Persistence

Status: In progress - broad-alpha garage/source-vehicle foundation exists.
Capture, cargo preservation, dry-ground redeploy, field-vehicle snapshot/
restore, runtime/source metadata, and typed reports/probes exist. Exact
anti-duplication transactions, repair/rearm/refuel rules, progression limits,
and restart/multiplayer soak remain open.

Goal: make captured vehicles a reliable campaign progression system.

Implementation:

- Capture nearby vehicle into garage.
- Validate vehicle root.
- Validate vehicle is not occupied.
- Capture physical and virtual cargo.
- Delete physical vehicle only after garage record is prepared.
- Redeploy vehicle near HQ.
- Restore cargo on redeploy.
- Track ammo/repair/fuel source vehicles.

Acceptance criteria:

- Captured vehicle appears in garage report.
- Captured vehicle despawns from world.
- Vehicle cargo is preserved.
- Redeployed vehicle spawns at safe HQ position.
- Garage record is removed or updated according to redeploy policy.
- Ammo truck is recognized as ammo source.
- Save/load preserves garage vehicles and cargo.

## Phase 16 - Recruitment, Training, And Garrisons

Status: In progress - recruitment, training, abstract garrisons, exact visible
garrison quotes, and typed smoke coverage exist. Executable exact garrison
manifests, arsenal-driven AI loadouts, static defenses, broader typed command
cutovers, and runtime/restart proof remain open.

Goal: connect HR, money, training, arsenal unlocks, and abstract garrisons.

Implementation:

- Recruit FIA units using HR and money.
- Train troops using faction money.
- Training level affects AI quality.
- Arsenal unlocks affect recruit loadouts.
- Commander can add/remove garrison units.
- Garrison records remain abstract until activated.
- Active group survivors fold back into garrison state.

Acceptance criteria:

- Recruiting spends HR and money.
- Training spends faction money and increases training level.
- Recruit report changes when weapons unlock.
- Garrison can be added to a friendly zone.
- Entering a zone activates garrison physically.
- Killing part of a garrison and leaving folds survivors back.
- Save/load preserves garrisons.

## Phase 17 - Zone Capture And Ownership

Status: In progress - capture progress, ownership flips, starter garrisons,
counterattack triggers, markers/reports, and typed smoke coverage exist.
Canonical all-side-effect ownership transitions, political town control,
facility/logistics consequences, JIP projection, and soak remain open.

Goal: make the map conquest loop work.

Implementation:

- Detect players/FIA inside capture radius.
- Detect hostile active groups inside capture radius.
- Progress capture only when FIA are present and hostiles are cleared or below
  threshold.
- Pause or decay progress when contested.
- Flip owner when progress reaches threshold.
- Create/update FIA garrison after capture.
- Update markers.
- Trigger enemy counterattack chance.

Acceptance criteria:

- Empty enemy outpost can be captured by holding.
- Hostile presence pauses capture.
- Capture progress appears in report/UI.
- Zone owner changes to FIA on completion.
- Marker changes owner/color.
- Enemy counterattack order can be queued.
- Save/load preserves captured owner and progress.

## Phase 18 - Enemy Commander Physical Responses

Status: In progress - resource-limited order selection, proactive/reactive pool
separation, physical/abstract response, target scoring, and typed smoke coverage
exist. Schema 51 makes newly planned infantry-only defensive QRF the first exact
enemy-order cutover: one frozen prepaid roster travels outbound, materializes or
folds with exact survivors, applies defensive pressure once, returns to origin,
and settles proportional survivor resources once. Existing rows and every other
enemy order remain on their legacy paths. Packaged sustained movement/contact,
arrival/return/restart proof and long-window behavior remain open.

Goal: turn enemy orders into visible war activity.

Enemy order types:

- Patrol
- QRF
- Counterattack
- Rebuild garrison
- Roadblock
- Support call
- Petros attack

Implementation:

- Keep enemy resource spending server-authoritative.
- Queue enemy orders from aggression, war level, capture events, and HQ
  knowledge.
- Physicalize QRF/counterattack only near players or active objectives.
- Resolve off-screen orders abstractly.
- Update garrisons, roadblocks, support requests, or mission state on
  resolution.
- For a newly planned infantry-only defensive QRF, select a distinct
  same-faction source, freeze and debit one exact roster, suppress a parallel
  legacy QRF/support response, and keep strategic travel active off-screen.
- Require two live-position samples from distinct campaign seconds for physical
  target/origin arrival. Apply target pressure once, return exact survivors, and
  settle one deterministic resource refund. A fold alone never settles.

Acceptance criteria:

- Enemy order report shows queued/active/resolved orders.
- Capturing a zone can trigger counterattack.
- Counterattack spends enemy resources.
- If players stay nearby, counterattack can spawn physically.
- If players leave, order resolves abstractly.
- Rebuild order increases enemy garrison.
- Roadblock order increases roadblock presence.
- Exact enemy defensive QRF creates one order/operation/manifest/batch/group
  aggregate and no legacy support or QRF row.
- Exact enemy defensive QRF preserves casualties through materialize/fold and
  restore, then refunds only the surviving fraction after return.

## Phase 19 - Support Requests

Status: In progress - queued state, ETA, cooldown, reports, physical/abstract
resolution, cancellation/recall scaffolding, a typed recall result/explicit
visible-command receipt path, and typed smoke coverage exist.
Player-paid infantry QRF is the first exact support consumer; other support
types remain legacy. Schema 50 gives only that exact infantry QRF persistent
direct-route movement while virtual, proximity-based materialization/fold with
hysteresis, an exact frozen-slot roster, and bounded on-station virtual infantry
combat. When physical, support still treats ETA as an earliest check and
requires two live samples from distinct elapsed seconds within 75m for arrival
or recall exit. Reliable packaged virtual travel, projection transfer, combat,
physical travel/arrival/return, settlement, and restart proof remains open.

Goal: make FIA and enemy support requests stateful and testable.

Implementation:

- Player/FIA support requests: supply support and ground support; future
  mortar/air only if assets exist.
- Enemy support requests: QRF, patrol/search, ground support, and abstract
  helicopter-style support if no safe asset path exists.
- Each request validates cost/cooldown, records source/target, has ETA, and
  physicalizes or resolves abstractly.
- The exact paid player infantry QRF keeps one operation and one frozen-slot
  roster across virtual travel, materialization, physical fold, virtual combat,
  recall, settlement, and restore. This rule does not apply to other supports.
- Spawned requests route directly from the current living-member centroid to the
  current target or recall exit. Service-owned waypoint replacement is
  transactional and stalled chains have a maximum of three consecutive reissues
  until an observed 8m new-best distance improvement resets the stall budget.
- Recall exposes accepted/already-applied/state-changed/terminal disposition and
  operation identity. Presentation wording never decides receipt authority;
  exact full refunds prevalidate both linked ledger legs before either changes.

Acceptance criteria:

- FIA support request appears in support report.
- Enemy support request spends enemy resources.
- Request has ETA and status.
- ETA alone cannot complete a spawned request; live distance must confirm
  arrival, and recall settlement must confirm the spawned group reached its
  exit.
- Request resolves physically when players are nearby.
- Legacy requests may resolve abstractly when players are far; an exact paid
  infantry QRF instead remains virtual and continues its operation.
- Cooldown prevents spam.
- Save/load preserves active support requests.
- Save/load restores an open exact infantry QRF as one held virtual projection
  with the same confirmed survivor/casualty slots and no process-local entities.

## Phase 20 - Civilians, Town Support, And Undercover Reports

Status: In progress - town influence/population ledgers, aid, ownership
consequences, civilian projection, undercover eligibility, and typed reports/
smoke coverage exist. A packaged schema-49 run proved civilian traffic can move
but exposed repeated town appearances, stuck horns, missing Figari/Morton
ambience from HQ-coupled military activation, and full-town ambience at a minor
woodland locality. Schema-50 source separates civilian eligibility, selects
concrete variants, defaults true towns to five traffic vehicles, limits that
locality to two pedestrians, and clears HST-owned ambient horn input. Publish/
soak proof, political mission outputs, and canonical ownership remain open.

Goal: make the civilian layer visible and start enforcing undercover rules
gradually.

Implementation:

- Town support report: FIA support, occupier support, reputation, wanted heat,
  police presence, and roadblock presence.
- Classify curated stock town centers separately from minor localities; military
  HQ-safety suppression must not erase civilian life near a player.
- Give true towns five driven ambient vehicles by default and deterministic
  non-repeating concrete civilian appearances. Minor localities receive their
  smaller configured pedestrian budget without town-scale traffic.
- Reset horn input only for HST-owned ambient drivers and clean their vehicles,
  groups, and waypoints when the locality leaves the render bubble.
- Undercover eligibility report: clothing reason, weapon reason, vehicle
  reason, off-road reason, enemy proximity reason, and wanted heat reason.
- Add player commands to request undercover, clear compromised undercover, and
  show undercover status.

Acceptance criteria:

- Town report shows support/reputation/wanted state.
- Undercover report gives explicit eligibility reason.
- Civilian clothing can be eligible.
- Military equipment can be ineligible.
- Wanted heat can block or compromise undercover.
- Save/load preserves civilian and undercover state.
- Figari and Morton project town ambience near a player even when their hostile
  garrison is held inactive by HQ safety; the known woodland locality projects
  two pedestrians and no town traffic.

## Phase 21 - Undercover Enforcement And Police/Roadblocks

Status: In progress - undercover apply/clear, wanted and vehicle heat,
weapon/vehicle compromise, police/roadblock scans, and typed smoke coverage
exist. Live equipment/clothing/off-road enforcement, behavior-ready security
actors, multiplayer feedback, and soak remain open.

Goal: move from reports to actual undercover gameplay.

Implementation:

- Apply undercover state to player.
- Detect suspicious actions: weapon drawn/fired, military gear, military
  vehicle, off-road driving near enemies, restricted zone entry, and
  roadblock/checkpoint scan.
- Compromise player when detection succeeds.
- Increase wanted heat after hostile/civilian incidents.
- Roadblocks and police increase detection chance.
- Report why undercover was lost.

Acceptance criteria:

- Player can enter undercover when eligible.
- Player loses undercover when firing/drawing weapon near enemies.
- Military vehicle blocks undercover.
- Roadblock/police presence can compromise player.
- Compromise reason is visible.
- Wanted heat decays or clears according to rules.

## Phase 22 - HQ Threat And Defend Petros

Status: In progress - HQ knowledge/threat, Petros attack orders, linked support/
group/mission/objective/task state, campaign consequences, and typed smoke
coverage exist. Spawned Petros-attack support now uses the same live-centroid,
direct-target, two-sample arrival boundary. A historical 9/9 attacker group did
not show advance, but campaign-time-only sampling is not physical-stall proof.
Natural movement/contact/arrival, multi-wave defense, recovery policy, restart,
and multiplayer proof remain open.

Goal: implement the signature enemy punishment loop around HQ knowledge and
Petros.

Implementation:

- Track HQ knowledge.
- Increase HQ knowledge from traitor failure, enemy patrol near HQ, player
  activity near HQ, and high-aggression events.
- Enemy commander can queue Petros attack.
- Spawn enemy attack groups at HQ standoff positions.
- Mission objective: defend Petros for duration or eliminate attackers.
- Failure: Petros killed, HR/money penalty, possible forced HQ move or
  recovery.

Acceptance criteria:

- HQ knowledge is visible in report.
- Enemy commander can queue Petros attack.
- Defend Petros mission starts.
- Attackers spawn outside HQ safe radius.
- Petros death fails mission.
- Successful defense clears/lowers threat or completes mission.
- Save/load preserves active defend-Petros mission.

## Phase 23 - UI And Map Marker Polish

Status: In progress - broad-alpha command-menu and marker paths exist, and the
packaged schema-49 run proved that map publication returned with the stock HUD.
It also exposed invalid radio icons as giant boxes, owner-only labels, pointer-
under-dialog ordering, and duplicate radio transmitters. Schema-50 source
validates/resolves the radio icon dynamically, labels location plus owner, keeps
map-local overlays below the native pointer, and reuses authored transmitters.
Schema 51 additionally publishes the open exact enemy defensive-QRF operation at
its strategic/live cursor with living count, duty, endpoints, and ETA. Schema
52 publishes one aggregate exact-convoy marker at its strategic/live operation
position and suppresses three per-vehicle markers. Focused
packaged verification plus event-driven reconnect/JIP proof remains open under
CRI-6.

Goal: make the campaign understandable without reading logs.

Implementation:

- Improve menu tabs: Overview, HQ/Petros, Missions, Map/War, Forces,
  Arsenal/Loot, Members, and Admin.
- Improve marker behavior for zone owners, active missions, objectives,
  convoy last-known position, support/QRF, capture progress, and HQ marker
  visibility rules.
- Preserve the canonical placed-marker table, append/repair radio normal/glow
  resources by identity, and reject invalid icon entries rather than assuming a
  stock array index.
- Keep map-target prompt/indicator/dialog in the map-local layer below the native
  pointer, and bind radio missions to an existing damageable transmitter when
  one is already present.
- Publish one marker for every open schema-51 exact enemy defensive-QRF
  operation at its strategic or live position, including faction, living count,
  duty, immutable route endpoints, and ETA. Remove it when the operation closes.
- Publish one aggregate marker for every open schema-52 exact convoy operation
  and suppress its per-vehicle markers. Remove it after terminal settlement.

Acceptance criteria:

- Player can understand active mission state from the menu.
- Convoy marker updates while moving.
- Zone markers update after capture.
- Zone marker text contains both the location name and current owner.
- Radio markers remain normal-sized and an authored radio site has one tower.
- The native pointer remains visible over map-target confirmation dialogs.
- Support/QRF markers appear when relevant.
- Exact enemy defensive-QRF markers follow virtual/physical travel and disappear
  on terminal settlement without a duplicate legacy marker.
- Exact mission-convoy markers follow virtual/physical travel as one operation
  and disappear on terminal settlement without three oversized vehicle rows.
- Failed actions show clear result text.
- Admin/debug actions are separated from normal player actions.
- UI preserves command/report paths for every feature introduced by the phase
  plan.
- Service failure reasons are shown verbatim or safely summarized instead of
  being hidden behind generic UI text.

## Phase 24 - Balance, Campaign Pacing, And Victory/Loss

Status: In progress - population outcome default. Strategic pacing and enemy
pressure smoke exists; population-support victory/loss is implemented and still
needs real restart/multiplayer soak.

Goal: turn working systems into a coherent campaign loop.

Implementation:

- Tune starting HR/money/training.
- Tune income intervals and values.
- Tune arsenal unlock thresholds.
- Tune mission rewards and penalties.
- Tune aggression gain/decay.
- Tune enemy resource income/spending.
- Tune war-level thresholds.
- Default victory: remaining population support reaches the configured
  threshold and all airfields are controlled.
- Default loss: killed population exceeds one third of initial population.
- Keep legacy control-percent victory optional for debug or alternate presets.
- Add campaign end report with population, support, airfield, outcome-mode,
  next-check, and persisted terminal metadata.

Acceptance criteria:

- War level increases as FIA gains territory.
- Enemy equipment/resource pressure scales with war level.
- Early game remains loot-focused.
- Mid game enables outpost/resource capture.
- Late game enables airfield/seaport pressure.
- Victory triggers only when population support and airfield control are both
  satisfied in default mode.
- Loss triggers when civilian killed population exceeds the catastrophe
  threshold in default mode.
- Campaign end state persists with outcome mode, population counts, support
  population, and airfield metadata.

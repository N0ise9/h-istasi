# h-istasi Enfusion / Enforce Notes

Purpose: capture reusable facts learned while building h-istasi so we do not rediscover the same Enfusion and Enforce Script edge cases repeatedly.

This file is for practical engine/script behavior, not project planning. Keep entries concrete: what failed, why it failed, what works instead, and where the example lives.

## UI Layouts

- Top-level UI layouts should be created with the workspace as the parent when they are meant to exist above game/map UI:
  - Use `workspace.CreateWidgets(LAYOUT, workspace)`.
  - This matches native UI patterns better than creating a top-level root with no parent.
  - Creation-time geometry can still report `0x0`; schedule a post-layout check before trusting bounds.

- Creation-time widget geometry is often not final.
  - `GetScreenSize` and `GetScreenPos` can return `0x0` immediately after `CreateWidgets`.
  - Use `GetGame().GetCallqueue().CallLater(..., 0, false)` and often a second pass around `50 ms` later for diagnostics or final visibility/z-order reassertion.
  - Current examples: `setup_prompt_ready`, `setup_confirm_modal_ready`, `notification_toast_ready`, `command_action_dialog_ready`, `mission_report_dialog_ready`, `command_menu_ready`, `loadout_editor_ready`.

- Ready diagnostics need to check more than layout creation.
  - A layout can be created and still be unusable because expected children are missing, hidden in hierarchy, or still reporting `0x0` bounds after anchor resolution.
  - Use `HST_UIDebug.LogReadyWidgetsCsv` in delayed ready passes beside geometry logs so playtest logs identify the exact failed widget state.
  - Negative sizes are different from delayed `0x0` layout resolution. Ready logs now separate `zero=`, `negative=`, and `offscreen=` so bad anchor signs are obvious.

- Row/list containers need post-layout child samples when debugging generated UI.
  - Creation-time row logs confirm data population, but list rows can still resolve into the wrong parent, wrong size, or wrong z-order after layout.
  - Use `HST_UIDebug.LogNamedChildSummaryCsv` during delayed ready passes for dynamic list hosts such as command tabs/main/actions and loadout slot/candidate/storage lists.
  - This logs the parent bounds plus the first few child widget bounds after Enfusion has settled anchors.

- Generated row and tile dimensions should live in the row layout resource.
  - Script-side `SizeLayoutWidget` overrides on every generated row reintroduce viewport-dependent geometry logic and can fight wrap/scroll hosts.
  - Prefer fixed `SizeLayoutWidget` dimensions in the row layout and let the parent `VerticalLayoutWidget` or `WrapLayoutWidget` place children.
  - Script should create the row, bind user ids, set colors/text/images, and leave row size to the layout.
  - Current example: `HST_LoadoutCandidateTile.layout` owns storage candidate tile width, height, and text bounds.

- Layout diagnostics must be runtime-gated.
  - Compile-time `static const` feature flags are useful as a hard kill switch, but every high-volume helper should also check the debug setting loaded from runtime settings.
  - Cache the loaded runtime setting in the debug helper so row/widget probes do not parse settings on every row.

- EDDS metafiles must have matching EDDS resources.
  - Runtime symptom: `RESOURCES (E): metafile without corresponding resource`.
  - If an icon is regenerated under a new path, delete any stale `.edds.meta` left behind at the old path; Workbench still scans it and reports the missing resource even when scripts reference the new GUID.
  - Current example: loadout editor search uses `Assets/512/search_icon.edds`; the old `Assets/1254/Search Icon.edds.meta` had no matching `.edds`.

- `root.FindAnyWidget(root.GetName())` may not find the root itself.
  - If debug code checks expected widgets and includes the root name, explicitly compare `root.GetName()` before reporting the root missing.

- A `ButtonWidget` does not accept arbitrary child widgets.
  - Runtime symptom: `GUI (E): Cannot add a child, the ButtonWidget CloseButton does not accept more children`.
  - Avoid putting custom `FrameWidget`/`PanelWidget`/`TextWidget` children inside a `ButtonWidget` unless the engine-provided slot pattern is known to work for that exact widget.
  - Stable workaround: make the button a real sibling hit target and place a sibling `TextWidget` over it with `Ignore Cursor = true`.
  - If a label renders blank while the button hit target still appears, first check whether the label is nested under the button. Move filter/sort/action labels out as siblings before chasing script-side text population.
  - Current examples: `HST_CommandMenu.layout` close button, `HST_SetupConfirmModal.layout` Yes/No labels, `HST_ActionDialog.layout` Cancel/Confirm labels, `HST_ReportDialog.layout` Close label, `HST_LoadoutEditor.layout` remove/filter/sort labels.

- If a layout-owned button does use a supported `ButtonWidgetSlot` child body, that body must fill the button slot.
  - Runtime symptom: the button rectangle is visible and clickable, but child labels report `0x0` or negative height and render blank.
  - Put `HorizontalAlign 3` and `VerticalAlign 3` inside the `Slot ButtonWidgetSlot {}` block for the body frame.
  - Current example: `HST_LoadoutEditor.layout` template/settings button bodies.

- Scripted layout bindings should only name widgets that actually exist in the layout resource.
  - Helpers such as `ConfigureStorageBrowserButton` can fail quietly for optional visual parts because `FindAnyWidget` returns null without a script error.
  - For layout-owned controls, keep hit targets, labels, accents, and other visual siblings named in the layout and validate those names against script calls.
  - If the button itself owns the background color, pass the button name for the background binding instead of inventing an unmatched `*Background` name.
  - Current example: `HST_LoadoutEditorComponent.ConfigureStorageBrowserButton` binds storage filter/sort/search buttons to sibling label/accent widgets in `HST_LoadoutEditor.layout`.

- Icon-only controls need text fallbacks wired from script.
  - A row layout can include a hidden fallback text widget, but it stays blank unless script populates and shows it when image loading fails.
  - Runtime symptom: storage/search tabs or controls appear as visible clickable buttons with no readable label if the icon resource is missing or not ready.
  - Current example: `HST_LoadoutEditorComponent.RenderStorageCategoryTabs()` sets `Fallback` through `GetStorageBrowserCategoryFallback()` when `SetLoadoutImageTexture()` fails.

- Fixed-width generated tab rows must be recalculated when the tab count changes.
  - Runtime symptom: a newly added storage/search tab is populated in logs but does not appear because the row prefab still has the wrong tab count width and padding.
  - For six storage browser tabs in the current right pane, `HST_LoadoutStorageCategoryTab.layout` uses compact tab cells and the host row uses symmetric insets so the tab strip stays centered after removing a category.

- Slot alignment keys must live inside the `Slot ... {}` block for the widget slot that owns them.
  - Runtime symptom: `GUI (E): Unknown keyword/data 'HorizontalAlign'` or `VerticalAlign` while loading the layout resource.
  - Do not put `HorizontalAlign` / `VerticalAlign` directly on a layout widget body such as `HorizontalLayoutWidgetClass`; move them into the slot block or remove them if the slot already stretches.
  - Current example: `HST_LoadoutEditor.layout` `TopTabItems`.

- Full-screen anchored roots should not be manually resized.
  - Avoid `FrameSlot.SetPos(root, 0, 0)` and `FrameSlot.SetSize(root, ...)` on roots using stretched anchors.
  - Runtime warning pattern: position/size only works when min/max anchors are the same.
  - Let layout anchors own full-screen geometry; script may set z-order, visibility, opacity, and text/data.

- Fixed-size centered modal panels should use the same `SizeX` / `SizeY` plus alignment pattern as working native dialogs.
  - Use `Anchor 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5`, `PositionX 0`, `OffsetLeft 0`, `PositionY 0`, `OffsetTop 0`, `SizeX width`, `OffsetRight -width`, `SizeY height`, `OffsetBottom -height`, and `Alignment 0.5 0.5`.
  - A setup confirmation modal using direct center-relative offsets such as negative left/top and positive right/bottom created the layout and populated text, but the dialog resolved to `0x0` and buttons had unusable or negative bounds.
  - Current examples: `HST_SetupConfirmModal.layout`, `HST_ActionDialog.layout`, `HST_ReportDialog.layout`.

- `OffsetRight` and `OffsetBottom` signs depend on whether a slot has explicit `SizeX` / `SizeY`, whether that axis stretches, and which side the fixed anchor uses.
  - Slots with explicit `PositionX` / `PositionY` plus `SizeX` / `SizeY` often serialize the far edge as negative, such as a centered modal using `SizeX 620` with `OffsetRight -620`.
  - Top/left same-anchor fixed boxes without explicit size need negative far edges, such as `Anchor 0 0 0 0`, `OffsetLeft 116`, and `OffsetRight -560`. Positive far edges produced negative runtime sizes for top tabs, left buttons, left rail, and footer chrome.
  - Top/left same-anchor fixed-height children also need explicit `SizeY` with a negative far edge, such as `OffsetTop 72`, `SizeY 78`, and `OffsetBottom -150`. Positive far edges can collapse tab strips and text bands even when the parent panel is visible.
  - Stretched inset panels need positive far-edge margins, such as `Anchor 0 0 1 1`, `OffsetLeft 240`, and `OffsetRight 524`. Negative far-edge margins made command-menu center and right panels grow underneath sibling panels.
  - Right or bottom anchored fixed boxes can use negative left/top offsets to define size while keeping positive right/bottom offsets inside the parent.
  - Runtime symptom when this is wrong: delayed ready logs show negative widget sizes or panels wider/taller than their parent, such as left rails, navigation panels, top tabs, command-menu center panels, or footer hints resolving to impossible bounds.
  - Current examples: `HST_SetupConfirmModal.layout`, `HST_CommandMenu.layout`, `HST_LoadoutEditor.layout`, loadout row layouts.

- Mode-owned header/action/settings controls need fixed-height slots just like visible chrome.
  - Workbench can show top-anchored header text, action buttons, or settings rows that use positive `OffsetBottom` values, but runtime can hide or collapse them when the mode panel is toggled and repopulated.
  - Use explicit `SizeY` and a negative far edge for candidate headers, remove buttons, and settings rows; keep stretched anchors only for containers that truly fill their parent.
  - Current example: `HST_LoadoutEditor.layout` candidate header/remove controls and settings rows.

- Layout fragments intended to fill a parent slot should use stretched anchors at their root.
  - A root `FrameWidget` with `Anchor 0 0 0 0` can resolve to `0x0` when created inside a dynamically populated placeholder.
  - Use `Anchor 0 0 1 1` for reusable item/preview fragments and let the parent list, tile, or placeholder own the actual dimensions.
  - Current example: `HST_LoadoutItemPreviewCell.layout`.

- Keep visual children passive unless they are real controls.
  - Use `WidgetFlags.IGNORE_CURSOR | WidgetFlags.NOFOCUS` or layout `Ignore Cursor = true` for passive panels, labels, overlays, and notification visuals.
  - Do not place invisible full-screen widgets unless they are intentional visible modal roots with real content.

- Widget event callbacks can pass a null `Widget`.
  - `ScriptedWidgetEventHandler` methods must guard `!w` before calling `w.GetUserID()` or passing the widget into component logic.
  - Runtime symptom when this is wrong: VM exception in `OnMouseButtonUp` with a null variable named `w`.

- Full-screen render targets need a repeatable sibling layer order.
  - Keep the render target container low in the root z-order and reassert visible UI panels above it after the layout has resolved.
  - Schedule a delayed ready pass for final geometry logs because render-target and UI-layer widgets can report `0x0` during creation.
  - Current example: `HST_LoadoutEditor.layout` with `ApplyLoadoutLayerOrder` and `loadout_editor_ready` diagnostics.

- Complex full-screen shells also benefit from one repeatable layer-order pass.
  - Keep geometry in the layout file, but reassert sibling z-order for dimmers, shell surfaces, panels, headers, and overlaid button labels after creation and delayed layout resolution.
  - Current example: `HST_CommandMenu.layout` with `ApplyCommandMenuLayerOrder` and `command_menu_ready` diagnostics.

- Long-lived screen roots should be reused while open.
  - Recreating a workspace-parented layout root during data refresh can leave input state, scroll state, and delayed layout diagnostics racing against a removed shell.
  - Keep the top-level root cached for screens such as the command menu, then clear only dynamic row/list hosts with `while (container.GetChildren()) container.GetChildren().RemoveFromHierarchy()`.
  - Current example: `HST_CommandMenuComponent.EnsureMenuRoot`, `ClearDynamicMenuRows`, and `ClearMenuContainerChildren`.

- Command-menu debug/report visibility should be server-authoritative.
  - Gate the Admin tab and report/debug action payloads from `HST_CommandUIService.BuildVisibleMenuPayload()` using `HST_RuntimeSettings.m_Debug.m_bDebugMenuEnabled`; do not rely on the client fallback tab list or admin role alone.
  - `ExecuteVisibleCommand()` should also reject debug/report command ids when the debug menu is disabled so manually submitted visible-menu ids cannot bypass hidden UI.
  - If a normal gameplay action previously used a `*_report` command id, expose a non-report gameplay id for the regular menu path so turning off the debug menu does not remove real gameplay controls.
  - Current examples: Overview undercover request/clear stays visible, Admin is omitted when debug menu is disabled, and Forces training uses `train_troops` instead of `train_troops_report`.

- Layout defaults should match the script's first meaningful state.
  - For mode-driven screens, mark always-on chrome explicitly visible and mark inactive mode panels hidden in the layout.
  - Let script show the active mode panel during population instead of relying on a cleanup pass to hide every inactive panel after creation.
  - Current example: `HST_LoadoutEditor.layout` keeps core chrome visible and starts candidate/storage/save panels hidden.

## Coordinates And DPI

- Workspace raw size and layout size are different under UI scaling.
  - Example seen in testing: raw `2560x1440`, layout `1920x1080`.
  - Use `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.GetRawWorkspaceSize` only for raw pixel needs.
  - Use `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.GetLayoutSize` for layout coordinates.
  - Use `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.LayoutToRawPx` / `RawToLayoutPx` for conversions.

- Keep direct `workspace.DPIUnscale` / `workspace.DPIScale` calls inside the metrics helper.
  - Map projection overlays still receive native raw screen coordinates from `SCR_MapEntity.WorldToScreen`, but should route those values through `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.RawToLayoutPx`.

- `SCR_MapEntity.WorldToScreen` gives native raw screen coordinates.
  - Convert projected x/y with `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.RawToLayoutPx` before `FrameSlot.SetPos`.
  - For world-radius circles, project the center and a world-space edge, derive the raw pixel radius, then convert the final raw size with `HST_UIWorkspaceMetrics.RawToLayoutPx`.

- `SCR_MapEntity.ScreenToWorld` must wait for map readiness.
  - Do not use it before the map is open, `OnMapOpenComplete` has fired, the map has advanced a few frames, and the map widget has non-zero size/valid zoom.
  - This avoids division-by-zero and invalid setup selections.

## Map UI

- `SCR_MapEntity.SetupMapConfig` caches the active map config by `EMapEntityMode`, not by config resource path.
  - If a custom setup map uses `EMapEntityMode.FULLSCREEN`, the next normal fullscreen map can reuse the setup config and keep the setup-only UI component stack.
  - Use a distinct map mode for custom setup maps, such as `PLAIN`, and keep the normal player map on `FULLSCREEN`.
  - Current example: `HST_SetupHQMap.conf` / `HST_SetupMapComponent` use `PLAIN`; `HST_GameplayMap.conf` inherits vanilla fullscreen behavior for the normal map.

- Setup map config and gameplay map config must stay separate.
  - Setup can use a minimal map config with setup selection behavior and optional setup overlays.
  - Gameplay should inherit/preserve vanilla `MapFullscreen.conf` tools and marker UI.
  - Setup-only components must not pollute normal map behavior after HQ placement.

- Campaign markers should use native map marker systems.
  - Let `SCR_MapMarkerManagerComponent` handle projection and pan/zoom.
  - Keep zone radius circles as optional `SCR_MapUIBaseComponent` overlays, not campaign markers.

- Dynamic player markers need a marker config entry before `InsertDynamicMarker` can work.
  - `SCR_MapMarkerManagerComponent.InsertDynamicMarker(type, entity, configId)` resolves `type` through the active `SCR_MapMarkerConfig`; stock `CampaignMapMarkerConfig.conf` does not expose every dynamic marker type.
  - The custom config must be the marker manager config on every gameplay/dev world layer that should show the marker. Having `Configs/Map/HST_PlayerMapMarkerConfig.conf` in the addon is not enough if the active layer still points at a config without `SCR_EMapMarkerType.HST_PLAYER`.
  - If a world layer still points at the vanilla marker config, patch the active `SCR_MapMarkerManagerComponent` before reconciliation with `EnsureHSTMarkerConfig`, loading `Configs/Map/HST_PlayerMapMarkerConfig.conf` and initializing its dynamic entries. The service should retry and log config readiness instead of silently inserting an unconfigured marker type.
  - Server-side config repair is not enough for dynamic marker rendering. `SCR_MapMarkerEntity.OnCreateMarker()` resolves its widget entry on the client from the local marker manager config, so custom player marker entities must also ensure `HST_PlayerMapMarkerConfig.conf` before vanilla widget creation asks for `SCR_EMapMarkerType.HST_PLAYER`.
  - Inherit the custom config from the known `CampaignMapMarkerConfig.conf` parent and copy required HQC squad entries into the HST config. Do not depend on an unverified parent GUID for `CampaignHQCMapMarkerConfig.conf`; a bad parent resource ID makes the whole marker config fail before the HST entry can be used.
  - Do not use `PLACED_CUSTOM` for tracked entities; it is a static marker type. For h-istasi player tracking, the world layers point the marker manager at `Configs/Map/HST_PlayerMapMarkerConfig.conf`, which inherits the campaign marker config and adds `HST_PlayerMapMarkerEntry`.
  - Do not reuse `SCR_EMapMarkerType.DYNAMIC_EXAMPLE` for custom dynamic markers. `SCR_MapMarkerConfig.GetMarkerEntryConfigByType` returns the first matching entry, and the parent map marker config already defines the stock example entry. Add a dedicated modded enum value such as `SCR_EMapMarkerType.HST_PLAYER`.
  - The stock `SCR_MapMarkerEntryDynamicExample` registers its own spawn/death handlers. If h-istasi owns marker lifecycle through a service/reconciler, use a custom `SCR_MapMarkerEntryDynamic` subclass, call `super.InitServerLogic()` to bind the manager, and do not register stock events.
  - Custom marker entry classes used from `.conf` need the same `[BaseContainerProps(), SCR_MapMarkerTitle()]` attributes as stock marker entries; without them the config entry can fail to instantiate even though the script class exists.
  - Runtime symptom: `Unknown class 'HST_PlayerMapMarkerEntry'` while loading `HST_PlayerMapMarkerConfig.conf` means the config can load but the marker entry script class was not registered/compiled for that run, so `InsertDynamicMarker` will not have a usable `HST_PLAYER` entry.
  - Validate both the imageset resource and the quad name. `{2EFEA2AF1F38E7F0}UI/Textures/Icons/icons_wrapperUI-64.imageset` has `circle` but not `dot`; using a missing quad can leave an otherwise created marker visually blank.
  - Current h-istasi player marker art uses the `whisper` quad from `{3262679C50EF4F01}UI/Textures/Icons/icons_wrapperUI.imageset`; keep the dynamic marker layout passive with `Ignore Cursor` so it cannot steal map interaction.
  - `SCR_MapMarkerEntity.SetText()` is not replicated. If server-created dynamic markers need per-player labels, pass a stable value through replicated marker data such as `configId` and resolve the client-side label in `InitClientSettingsDynamic`. Replicated marker fields can arrive around widget creation, so reapply labels briefly from the callqueue if the first pass only has fallback text.
  - Reconciler dynamic cleanup must remove tracked domain ids even if the stored `SCR_MapMarkerEntity` pointer is already null. A stale dynamic handle can poison tracked counts and prevent player marker cleanup/recreate from converging.
  - Matching tracked dynamic handle counts are not enough to skip player marker reconciliation. Check that tracked `SCR_MapMarkerEntity` references are still present in `SCR_MapMarkerManagerComponent.GetDynamicMarkers()`, and recreate handles that have unregistered from the native manager.
  - Player markers use a separate reconciler from campaign/HQ/zone markers. Include `HST_PlayerMapMarkerService.BuildRuntimeReport()` in native marker admin reports so tests can see desired player records, tracked handles, live native handles, native dynamic marker count, marker-config entry readiness, and last reconcile failures in one place.
  - Admin native-marker purge/recovery commands must clear both the campaign marker reconciler and the separate player marker reconciler. If player markers are enabled, queue a player marker refresh after purge so live player handles are recreated from current controlled entities.
  - `SCR_PlayerNamesFilterCache` can lag marker widget creation and may return shortened display text. Prefer `PlayerManager.GetPlayerName(playerId)` when it is available, then fall back to the filter cache, and retry for a few seconds before accepting a generic `Player X` label.
  - If `HST_PlayerMapMarkerService` logs `native reconcile failed`, first verify the active world layer `SCR_MapMarkerManagerComponent.m_sMarkerCfgPath`, the custom marker entry config, and the dedicated `SCR_EMapMarkerType.HST_PLAYER` enum.
  - For custom dynamic visuals with client-resolved image/text, do not rely on `SCR_MapMarkerEntryDynamic.InitClientSettingsDynamic()` because base marker text/imageset are not replicated for server-created dynamic markers. Set image/color/text directly in the custom entry and force a visible alpha on faction colors.
  - Dynamic marker config entries must name a layout with `SCR_MapMarkerDynamicWComponent` or a subclass. The default `SCR_MapMarkerEntryConfig` layout is `MapMarkerBase.layout`, and `MapMarkerSquadMember.layout` uses `SCR_MapMarkerSquadMemberComponent`; both lack the dynamic handler that `SCR_MapMarkerEntity.OnCreateMarker()` dereferences on map open.
  - Native dynamic markers follow movement through their target entity. `SCR_MapMarkerEntity.SetTarget()` enables frame updates, and authority-side `EOnFrame()` copies `m_Target.GetOrigin()` into the replicated marker position, so player markers should not be recreated just to follow walking/driving movement.
  - The current `whisper` player-marker icon needs a forward-facing rotation offset of `-50` degrees before applying player yaw to line the icon up with the in-game facing direction.
  - Server-created dynamic marker prefabs need exactly one valid replication component. For h-istasi player markers, prefer a standalone `SCR_MapMarkerEntity` prefab with one local non-spatial/non-streamable `RplComponent`, matching the native squad marker shape. Do not inherit `MapMarkerEntityBase.et` and then add another `RplComponent`; the duplicate-component warning (`SCR_MapMarkerEntity component RplComponent cannot be combined with component RplComponent`) can leave `FindComponent(BaseRplComponent)` null during marker init and make player markers reconcile but fail to render.
  - Vanilla `SCR_MapMarkerEntity.EOnInit()` assumes `FindComponent(BaseRplComponent)` succeeds. If a dynamic marker prefab/resource state can produce a marker entity without a resolved RPL component, guard the modded init path before calling `IsOwner()` or `InsertDynamicMarker` can throw `NULL pointer to instance. Variable 'rplComp'`. Keep the marker entity active when RPL is temporarily unavailable; `SetTarget()` only sets the frame event mask, while active frame updates are what copy the target position into the replicated marker position.
  - Player marker facing rotation lives in the marker widget component, not the marker service. `HST_PlayerMapMarkerDynamicWComponent` rotates only `MarkerIcon` from the player entity's map yaw, leaving `MarkerText` upright and avoiding extra server marker churn. The `whisper` icon art points roughly 50 degrees off its widget zero after in-game alignment, so apply the icon forward offset when converting yaw to widget rotation.
  - Current working player-marker layout: `{6985327711306214}UI/layouts/HST/Map/HST_PlayerMapMarkerDynamic.layout`.
  - Custom player marker entries that set a name must also call `SetTextVisible(true)`.
- Player markers should publish in gameplay-bearing campaign phases (`HST_CAMPAIGN_ACTIVE`, `HST_CAMPAIGN_WON`, and `HST_CAMPAIGN_LOST`) but not during setup/bootstrap. Campaign-debug phase 24 intentionally leaves the state terminal at the end of a run, and clearing player markers just because the phase is no longer active makes the post-run map look broken even though gameplay state still exists.
  - For faction-colored player markers, resolve `SCR_FactionManager.SGetPlayerFaction(playerId)` client-side and fall back to the FIA faction color before using a hardcoded color.
  - Player marker reconcile signatures must include the resolved player/entity faction key, not just player id, target entity, and name. Faction assignment can arrive after the marker is created, and skipping reconciliation on an unchanged entity can leave the native marker with stale stream rules.
  - Do not hard-code the native marker stream faction to FIA. Use `SCR_FactionManager.SGetPlayerFaction(playerId)` first, then the controlled entity's `FactionAffiliationComponent`, and leave the stream key empty if neither is available so a bad fallback does not hide the player's own marker.
  - HST player markers should call `SCR_MapMarkerEntity.SetFaction()` once a real player/entity faction is known so native map faction visibility can include them. Keep the widget icon/text color client-resolved from the same player faction, and avoid hardcoded fallback stream factions that can hide hosted-server markers.
  - `SCR_MapMarkersUI.CreateDynamicMarkers()` can call `SCR_MapMarkerEntity.OnCreateMarker()` before the map frame is actually usable. A log before `super.OnCreateMarker()` only proves creation was requested; the reliable success signal is a non-null marker root/widget component or the custom marker entry's `InitClientSettingsDynamic()` log.
  - Gameplay-map open repair should retry until HST dynamic player marker entities exist and their widgets are created. Treat `0` dynamic HST player markers as not-ready for a few retries, because the replicated marker entity can arrive after `OnMapOpenComplete`.
  - If a cached dynamic marker widget root is detached from the current map hierarchy, clear the root and widget component before rebuilding. Native dynamic marker deletion/removal paths can leave a stale reference even though the visible map root has been destroyed.
  - Current examples: `HST_PlayerMapMarkerService`, `HST_PlayerMapMarkerEntry`, `HST_PlayerMapMarkerConfig.conf`.

- Map overlay widgets must be passive.
  - Create overlay primitives with `IGNORE_CURSOR` / `NOFOCUS`.
  - Redraw only when content or viewport state changes enough to matter.
  - Do not redraw on every frame while idle.

- Setup-map zone labels are generated by `HST_MapZoneOverlayUIComponent`, not by `HST_SetupHQMap.layout`.
  - Change location-name text color in `DrawZone()` / `CreateZoneLabel()`.
  - When labels are created dynamically, set color on the cast `TextWidget` with `SetColorInt()` as well as any generic widget color; otherwise text can render with the layout/default color even though the widget exists.
  - Black setup location labels need a light outline/shadow halo because the underlying map texture varies; candidate labels can keep their candidate color.

- Keep map overlay redraw ownership in the map UI component.
  - Setup/map-flow components should publish content changes, such as setup zones or the temporary HQ candidate marker.
  - The `SCR_MapUIBaseComponent` overlay should own projection, revision checks, pan/zoom thresholds, and widget reuse.
  - Avoid a second dirty/redraw loop in the flow component; duplicate redraw ownership makes readiness and input bugs harder to isolate.

## Input And Widget Events

- Custom input actions need an active `ActionContext`, not just an `Action`.
  - `InputBinding.CreateUserBinding()` and `AddActionListener()` can appear successful for an action defined only under top-level `Actions`, but `GetActionTriggered()` and the listener may never fire because no active context owns the action.
  - Put mod-owned actions inside a custom `ActionContext`, register the config as a custom input config, and activate that context before polling or listening.
  - Current example: `Configs/HST/Input/HST_Input.conf` defines `HST_CommandMenuContext` with `HST_CommandMenu`, and `HST_CommandMenuComponent` activates that context before polling the `I` key command-menu action.
  - If a key is covered by both raw `Debug.KeyState()` fallback polling and an action-manager binding, consume the first edge for the frame before polling the second path. Otherwise one physical key press can produce duplicate open/close or debounce-refusal evidence that makes the input path look broken.
  - Log action edges, raw key edges, and UI-root refusal state while diagnosing input. A log that only says a component registered its listener does not prove the key path fired.

- Full-screen modal UIs that close on Escape need to consume both menu actions bound to Escape.
  - Base Reforger configs bind `KC_ESCAPE` to `MenuBack` and `MenuOpen`; listening only to `MenuBack` can close the mod UI and still let the native pause menu open from the same keypress.
  - HST workspace-widget overlays are not native `MenuBase` screens. The global Reforger `MenuOpen` path can therefore decide that no menu is open and spawn `PauseMenu` after the HST overlay closes.
  - While the modal is topmost, listen for `MenuBack`/`MenuOpen`, poll raw `KC_ESCAPE` as a fallback, call `Debug.ClearKey(KeyCode.KC_ESCAPE)`, reset the stock `MenuBack`/`MenuOpen` input actions, and schedule pause-menu dismiss retries for a short window while the original Escape press is still down.
  - `PauseMenuUI.m_OnPauseMenuOpened` is useful for workspace-widget overlays that are not visible to `MenuManager` as a native top menu. Register the guard only while the overlay is open, keep it through the short Escape-dismiss retry window, call `MenuManager.CloseMenuByPreset(ChimeraMenuPreset.PauseMenu)` or close the found pause menu, then unregister when the overlay and pending-dismiss window are both gone.
  - Current example: `HST_LoadoutEditorComponent` treats Escape/gamepad menu-back as a direct editor close; the on-screen Back button still uses the editor back stack.

- Real controls should be widget-driven.
  - Give interactive widgets stable `UserID`s and attach a `ScriptedWidgetEventHandler`.
  - Avoid raw coordinate hit testing for visible buttons.
  - When a render path programmatically syncs an `EditBoxWidget` with `SetText`, guard the paired `OnChange` handler so the sync cannot re-enter the render path. Attach the handler after the sync where practical, but still use an explicit guard because the reused widget may already have a handler.

- Some interactions may arrive through both `OnClick` and `OnMouseButtonUp`.
  - Prefer a single activation owner for normal buttons, usually `OnClick`.
  - Use duplicate-activation guards only where a widget action can unavoidably be triggered by both callbacks in the same frame.
  - Pass the mouse button through both event paths and key the guard by widget id, button, and frame serial so right-click/left-click actions remain distinct.
  - Current examples for guards include `HST_SetupMapComponent`, `HST_CommandMenuComponent`, and `HST_MissionClientComponent`; `HST_LoadoutEditorComponent` keeps normal button commands on `OnClick` and uses mouse-up only for preview drag release.

- Avoid synchronously deleting and rebuilding a newly added control subtree from that same control's callback.
  - Existing long-lived menus may tolerate direct `RenderEditor()` calls from established row buttons, but new filter/sort/search controls are safer when they mutate state and queue a zero-delay callqueue render.
  - This keeps the handler return path from walking widgets that were just destroyed by the render.
  - Current example: `HST_LoadoutEditorComponent.QueueStorageBrowserRender()` for storage filter/sort/search controls.
  - The storage browser tab list is the authority for server-side candidate categories and client search. When a tab is removed, narrow both `HST_LoadoutEditorService.IsStorageBrowserCandidateCategory()` and client search/category helpers so hidden wearable/container categories cannot be returned through search.
  - `RenderTargetWidget.SetClearColor(true, color)` is needed for loadout preview background presets because the render target can remain opaque over the UI backdrop; changing only the backdrop or a sky-sphere material may not affect the visible clear/background color.
  - Keep storage search scroll state separate from the normal storage candidate grid scroll. Search query/results intentionally persist while the editor stays open, but search rerenders should restore `m_fStorageSearchScrollY` rather than inheriting the category grid's `m_fStorageCandidateScrollY`.

- Modal state belongs in one coordinator.
  - `HST_UIRootService` tracks current screen, modal screen, blocking behavior, and topmost owner.
  - Repeated identical `RequestOpen` calls should be idempotent; otherwise refresh loops create noisy revision churn.
  - Use distinct screen modes for distinct modal families. Action confirmations register as `ACTION_DIALOG`; mission report/details dialogs register as `MISSION_DIALOG`.

- Screen input and modal input need separate ownership gates.
  - A full-screen UI should only process keyboard, preview drag, and widget clicks when `HST_UIRootService.CanHandleScreenInput(mode, owner)` matches that screen and no modal is above it.
  - A modal should process its buttons through `CanHandleModalInput(mode, owner)` instead of checking the underlying screen's open flag.
  - This matters when a contextual command opens only a confirmation modal while the command menu shell is closed; the modal still owns Yes/No input, but the closed screen should not receive normal menu navigation.
  - Current examples: command action dialogs, mission report close, and loadout editor preview drag/tab/back input.

- Shared confirmation rules need to cover both row clicks and contextual commands.
  - Command-menu row activation and contextual user actions can reach the same campaign mutation through different methods.
  - Put the confirmation decision in the destination UI component, not in a specific row factory, so actions such as HQ relocation and mission-objective completion cannot bypass the shared modal when triggered from world-space user actions.
  - If a contextual action opens only the confirmation modal while the command menu is closed, confirmed/cancelled callbacks must not call the full command-menu render path unless the menu is actually open.
  - Current example: `HST_CommandMenuComponent.ShouldConfirmAction`, `RunCommandFromContext`, and `RequestConfirmedAction`.

- A modal over a native map needs cursor handling split between the UI root and the map selection mode.
  - Do not activate `DialogContext` / `InteractableDialogContext` over the map just to make buttons clickable; those contexts can create an extra OS-style pointer over the map cursor.
  - Disable the current map selection mode directly, for example `ToggleLocationSelection(false)`, while the modal is waiting for an answer.
  - Use `SCR_MapCursorModule.HandleDialog(true)` / `HandleDialog(false)` for map-owned dialog state so the native map cursor is allowed to travel above the modal and selection/drag cursor modes are suppressed.
  - The native custom map cursor lives in its own workspace cursor layout at z-order `10`. Keep setup-map modal chrome above the map root but below that cursor band, for example modal root/dimmer/dialog/buttons/text in `1..9`, when the map cursor must remain visible over confirmation buttons.
  - Do not force `WidgetManager.SetCursor(0)` over an active map cursor; the native map cursor already hides the real cursor and forcing it back creates a second pointer.
  - Avoid modal-owned cursor proxy widgets over native map dialogs. They are easy to layer above the dialog, but they create a third visible cursor and drift from the engine cursor lifecycle.
  - Current example: `HST_SetupMapComponent`.

- Notifications should not participate in blocking input.
  - Keep toast roots and children cursor-ignored and no-focus.
  - Track notification depth separately from current/modal screens.

## Enforce Script Practicalities

- `string.Format` placeholders are limited to `%1` through `%9`.
  - Do not use `%10` or higher in diagnostics or reports; split the report into multiple `string.Format` calls or append the remaining values with string concatenation.

- Enforce compile validation can reject very wide helper signatures with `Maximum arguments count 16 exceeded`.
  - Campaign debug case/probe helpers should pass a small runtime context object once they need many observed fields. Current example: `HST_CampaignDebugSupportProbeContext` carries support ETA/status/physicalization observations between the support runtime probe and typed assertion builder.
  - Keep assertion calls flat in large debug builders: compute `actual` strings and status booleans before `AddCampaignDebugAssertion(...)` instead of nesting several helper calls inside the assertion call.
  - Avoid reusing generic parameter names such as `request` across adjacent support helpers when fixing wide signatures; a previous support probe refactor produced follow-on `Multiple declaration of variable` errors until the shared state moved into a context object and parameters were renamed to `supportRequest`.

- Avoid redundant `Cast(...)` calls when the API already returns the requested base type.
  - Workbench reports this as `No need to use 'Cast' for up-casting`.
  - Current example: `AIAgent.GetMovementComponent()` can be returned directly from a method typed as `AIBaseMovementComponent`.

- Campaign debug physical probes should recover or block on player liveness before real interactions.
  - `SCR_DamageManagerComponent.FullHeal()` is useful only for a non-destroyed controlled entity; destroyed players need the normal h-istasi respawn sweep.
  - Put liveness guards at the teleport/interaction boundary so later cargo, captive, or area probes do not report misleading `player is not alive` mission-action failures caused by an earlier physical probe.
  - Do not pre-block render-bubble, civilian population, or similar physical probes solely because the current controlled entity is not living. If bootstrap has not already marked physical tests blocked, call the shared campaign-debug living-player recovery path first, then record `BLOCKED` only if recovery still cannot produce a living entity.

- Vehicle source capability metadata is persisted state from campaign schema 19 onward.
  - Use prefab-based `HST_VehicleCapabilityPolicy` backfill for pre-schema-19 saves, new captures, or direct world scans; do not reapply it during current-schema save restore because it can erase explicit source flags.
  - When redeploying a garage vehicle, copy its persisted source kind and ammo/repair/fuel flags onto the runtime record and preserve those copied values.

- Prefer explicit boolean checks for object references when returning a bool.
  - `if (widget) return true;` is clearer and safer than returning widget-reference expressions from `bool` methods.

- `CallLater` supports delayed UI repair/diagnostic passes and can accept arguments.
  - Existing examples with arguments include notification dismissal generation checks and preview entity finalization.

- Reused layout roots need container cleanup, not just tracked-widget cleanup.
  - If generated rows are created into layout-owned containers and the root is reused, remove tracked dynamic widgets and then remove all children from the dynamic containers before repopulating.
  - Hidden or parent-hidden generated widgets can survive a mode switch if cleanup only clears visible children. Remove tracked dynamic widgets regardless of current visibility before the container sweep.
  - Reused static widgets should not call `AddHandler(m_WidgetHandler)` on every render. Route editor-owned bindings through an idempotent helper that checks `FindHandler(EditorWidgetHandlerType)` before adding the handler, or repeated renders can stack callbacks on filter/sort/close buttons.
  - `FrameWidgetSlot` does not accept `HorizontalAlign` / `VerticalAlign`. Keep those keys inside `AlignableSlot` or `OverlayWidgetSlot`; if the parser reports unknown alignment keywords at layout load time, inspect the nearest generated `FrameWidgetSlot` first.
  - When script populates text into layout-owned controls, set a known font in the common text setter. Newly added `TextWidget` labels without `FontProperties` can otherwise appear as blank clickable buttons even though the widgets exist.
  - Do not route normal button activation through both `OnClick` and `OnMouseButtonUp`. Use mouse-up only for drag state that explicitly consumes the event; otherwise return false and let `OnClick` perform the command once.
  - For layout-owned buttons whose label is a sibling `TextWidget`, validate and log both the button binding and the label widget summary when debugging blank labels. A visible/clickable button with a missing, hidden, zero-sized, or behind-parent label otherwise looks like a script click problem in the runtime log.

- Keep live inventory payloads single-owner.
  - If a server payload emits real storage contents as storage-node children, do not also re-emit those same entries as synthetic top-level inventory rows.
  - A simple guard is to treat slots with `m_sSlotKind == "storage_item"` or a non-empty parent slot id as nested storage rows only.
  - Clearing only an array of widgets misses rows that were not inserted into that array and causes tabs/lists to accumulate stale entries.
  - Hidden layout regions may not be reliably found by a global cleanup pass, depending on visibility and resolution timing.
  - Clear the active dynamic container again after the region has been resolved and shown, then populate it.
  - Treat the selected loadout edit target as a single resolved context, not as separate slot-only and node-only states. A layout row may leave only a selected slot id while candidate payloads and remove commands still need the live node id.
  - Invalidate compatible-item candidate payloads after loadout or storage mutations. Arsenal counts, storage capacity, and compatibility can change immediately after inserting/removing an item, so a cached empty candidate result can become stale.
  - Storage candidate troubleshooting needs separate counts for recovered arsenal items, slot/category matches, and live inventory compatibility matches. A category can have recovered items and still return an empty visible panel because the selected storage has no live insert target, no free capacity, or no compatible slots after the last insertion.
  - Storage candidate payloads should include matching recovered arsenal items even when the selected storage cannot currently accept them, with the `compatible` field carrying the fit result. Keep non-storage candidate lists server-filtered to compatible items only.
  - Magazine ammo usability can be computed independently from storage fit. This lets the UI show an "ammo usable" filter even when the item cannot fit in the selected container.
  - Storage capacity display should mirror `SCR_InventoryStorageBaseUI`: direct inventory storages can use `GetOccupiedSpace()` / `GetMaxVolumeCapacity()`, but `ClothNodeStorageComponent` capacity must be summed from owned `SCR_UniversalInventoryStorageComponent` instances. The cloth-node component itself can report misleading full/empty percentages.
  - Storage browser filter/sort state belongs in the local visual settings file, not the campaign state. Defaults should be fit-only and A-Z, with server authority still enforced by `add_storage_item`.
  - The storage ammo filter is tab-contextual. Keep its saved bit when leaving the ammunition tab, but only apply and show it active while `m_sSelectedCategory == "magazine"` so other tabs do not appear filtered by ammo.
  - Name sort direction and count sort direction are separate settings. When count sorting is selected, use count as the primary order and A-Z/Z-A as the tie-breaker; this lets the UI show `A-Z`/`Z-A` and `INF-1`/`1-INF` together.
  - Non-fitting storage candidates should keep their arsenal count badge. Use a light red row highlight for the fit failure and let the server-authoritative `add_storage_item` path reject clicks that still do not fit.
  - Structural pouch/holster/bandolier/carrier/scabbard/sheath/e-tool carrier or case-style storage attachments should not be emitted as addable storage-browser candidates. Check prefab, display, and short display names before spawning compatibility probes, because Reforger item paths and localized display names can expose different structural-container clues. These attachments can be child containers on looted webbing, but the player should add/remove the parent webbing or magazines inside those child pouches, not the pouch prefab itself.
  - Block structural inventory containers at deposit time and purge them from saved arsenal state. The current common bucket is non-loadout-clothing entities with structural attachment/cargo storage plus display/prefab tokens such as personal belongings, pouch, holster, bandolier/bandoleer, scabbard, sheath, compass case, suspenders, and e-tool/entrenching-tool carriers. Do not block real wearable backpacks/field packs or loadout cloth components just because they have cargo storage.
  - Structural wearable/storage prefab tokens are inconsistent. Treat `fieldpack`, `field_pack`, `field pack`, `ruck*`, and ALICE pack names as backpack/wearable storage aliases, while blocking `pouch`, e-tool `carrier`/`case`/`holder`/`cover` qualifiers, and similar structural child containers from arsenal storage candidates. Do not block the actual equippable entrenching tool just because its name contains `etool` or `entrenching tool`.
  - Run structural child-container token checks before source-category fallback in the loadout editor. If an arsenal entry arrives as `backpack`, `vest`, or generic equipment but its prefab/display says `buttpack`, `pouch`, `scabbard`, `compass case`, or e-tool carrier/case/cover, classify it as utility and let the structural filter block it instead of letting the source category resurrect it as wearable gear.
  - Broad `carrier` text is not enough by itself to block an item; real wearable armor carriers exist. Treat carrier as structural only with stronger context such as entrenching-tool, compass, radio, pouch, or case-style tokens.
  - Area-loot classification needs the same wearable/container resolver as the loadout editor. Worn BDU blouses, ALICE webbing, vests, pants, and backpacks can have cargo storage and still be real loot; classify them as loadout clothing before the structural cargo-storage probe. Explicit structural tokens such as pouches, suspenders, compass cases, scabbards, and e-tool carriers still win before wearable exemptions.
  - Storage content rows should gather from every insert-capable storage under the selected worn container, then filter out structural container shell entities before grouping rows. This lets magazines/flashlights inserted into webbing child pouches show in the bottom-left contents without showing the pouch/carrier as an add/remove item.
  - For worn webbing such as ALICE, insert-capable storage means the real cargo/deposit storages reached by recursing into child pouches, not the parent `ClothNodeStorageComponent` or structural attachment slots themselves. Including structural attachment storages in the insert/capacity list can inflate percentages, target pouch shells, and reject otherwise valid cargo inconsistently.
  - Treat paper map item prefabs as arsenal-equivalent across factions. `PaperMap_01_folded_US`, `PaperMap_01_folded_USSR`, `PaperMap_01_folded_FIA`, and the generic folded map should share arsenal lookup, issued-loadout lookup, saved-loadout cost grouping, and refund/withdraw accounting.
  - Keep client search filtering and server candidate/deposit filtering on the same shared token helper (`HST_ArsenalItemFilter.HasBlockedStructuralContainerToken`). A separate client-only list can miss cases such as compass cases or suspenders and show entries the server will reject.
  - Explicit blocked structural tokens must run before any broad wearable exemption. After pouch/carrier/case-style tokens are rejected, `BaseLoadoutClothComponent` is a valid wearable signal because some real clothing/backpack/webbing items arrive from loot classification as generic equipment or utility.
  - Bandages/field dressings use medicine-prefab paths and may not include the word `Bandage` in the prefab. Classify `Medicine`, `FieldDressing`, `FirstAid`, `Bandage`, `Morphine`, `Tourniquet`, and `Medkit` tokens as `medical` before falling back to generic equipment.
  - Storage-browser candidate preview keys must ignore `live_storage_item_` draft slots. Changing the contents of the selected container should refresh inventory lists and capacity bars, but it should not rebuild/refocus the rendered entity unless the displayed container/gear actually changes.
  - Wrap-layout storage grids need children whose root slot is `WrapLayoutWidgetSlot`, and the tile's inner `SizeLayout` must not horizontally fill the parent. Reusing a vertical-row layout or a fill-aligned size wrapper can collapse the right-hand storage browser to a single column even when a fixed tile width is set from script.
  - If a wrap-grid child is a clickable `ButtonWidget`, also keep a `SizeLayoutWidget` child with explicit width/height and enforce those overrides when creating rows. Otherwise the button root can stretch to the scroll width and visually behave like a single-column list even under a `WrapLayoutWidget`.
  - Do not use `LayoutSlot` manipulation helpers on a widget whose root slot is `WrapLayoutWidgetSlot`; the engine logs an invalid-slot error and click handlers can crash. Resize storage-browser tiles through the inner `SizeLayoutWidget` width/min/max overrides instead.
  - Two-column storage browser tiles need to derive width from the active right pane, not a single global constant. Reserve room for panel margins, tile padding, and the scrollbar, then clamp to a practical min/max so narrow panes keep two columns and wide panes use the available text area.
  - Worn clothing swapped through live inventory can expose useful cargo through `BaseInventoryStorageComponent.GetOwnedStorages()` even when the direct clothing storage has no insertable slots. Discover owned cargo/deposit storages before skipping zero-slot parent storage components, or BDU blouses, ALICE webbing, and similar swapped clothing can disappear from the storage tab while still showing capacity in the vanilla inventory UI.
  - Some worn clothing/webbing cargo storages live on child entities under the equipped item rather than on the equipped entity's own storage component or owned-storage list. Bounded child-entity recursion is needed when collecting cargo/deposit storages for the storage tab.
  - Some swapped clothing storage is volume-only from the loadout editor's perspective. Treat a storage with `GetMaxVolumeCapacity() > 0` as capacity-bearing even if `GetSlotsCount() == 0`, then recurse owned/deposit storages for actual insert targets and contents.
  - Empty live loadout slot compatibility sometimes needs a category fallback before exact `LoadoutAreaType` equality. Looted backpacks/field packs can be correctly classified as `backpack` in the arsenal while the native slot-area type comparison still rejects them, so validate the live node category first for loadout clothing categories.
  - Parent worn-slot replacement candidates must pass prefab/display-derived wearable category filtering before trusting native live storage compatibility. Some accessory items such as canteens are `BaseLoadoutClothComponent` child-slot items and may pass `CanReplaceItem`, but they are not valid Jacket/Headgear/Pants/Boots/Backpack parent-slot replacements.
  - Keep armored vests and load-bearing webbing as distinct editor categories. PASGT/armor vests should label as `Armored Vest`; ALICE/LBE/chest-rig/grenadier-style webbing should label as `Chest Rig`. Run backpack alias detection before webbing detection so ALICE packs/field packs remain backpack candidates.

- Loadout editor saved loadouts:
  - Fixed save slots are server-owned campaign state and profile persistence. Passing `slot_N` to `loadout_save` selects the slot; it must not overwrite an already renamed display name unless the slot was empty or an explicit rename command was sent.
  - Use `JsonSaveContext.SaveToString()` and `JsonLoadContext.LoadFromString()` with `SCR_PlayerArsenalLoadout.ReadLoadoutString/ApplyLoadoutString`. Obsolete `SCR_Json*` helpers can compile with warnings or fail to round-trip current native loadout data.
  - Serialized native saved loadouts include attachment and child-slot metadata that may not be present as h-istasi recovered arsenal entries. For serialized slots, skip attachment metadata and other missing-arsenal rows in the cost ledger instead of failing before `SCR_PlayerArsenalLoadout.ApplyLoadoutString()` can apply the saved native string.
  - After a successful serialized native loadout apply, refresh the server-side `SCR_PlayerController` main entity with `SetInitialMainEntity(playerEntity)`. h-istasi applies in place, but the controller refresh still helps possession/UI systems observe the changed entity state.
  - Campaign-debug loadout apply probes should not call `loadout_save` just to create a fixture, because that writes personal fixed-slot loadout files. Seed transient `HST_SavedLoadoutState` records directly, call the real `RequestMemberApplySavedLoadout()` path, then remove those records and restore the full arsenal plus the player's issued-loadout ledger from a pre-probe snapshot. Serialized apply uses the normal transaction path, which returns every previously issued finite item not present in the new loadout; restoring only the debug test prefabs can zero the player's issued ledger and duplicate refunded arsenal.
  - To test valid apply transaction semantics without leaving a new physical kit on the debug actor, capture the actor's current native serialized loadout and use it on the transient valid loadout while arranging explicit finite-cost slots for ledger assertions. This proves command, native apply, withdrawal, issued-ledger, and cleanup behavior without requiring `loadout_save`.
  - To test physical saved-loadout reflection, seed a second transient non-serialized loadout with explicit compact finite slots, apply it through `RequestMemberApplySavedLoadout()`, count the player inventory before/after, then apply a transient restore loadout that uses the original native serialized string. Keep this debug-only and restore arsenal/issued state afterward; rendered editor UI and exact equipment-slot visual proof remain separate.
  - Non-serialized saved-loadout apply inserts every saved slot through the normal inventory insertion path. Do not try to create capacity by adding a backpack/carrier as another non-serialized slot: the backpack itself is inserted as cargo and can fail first with `Inventory Full`. Use compact finite fixtures for the physical reflection probe; if a future test needs guaranteed new storage, arrange it through an equipped/serialized loadout step or mark the physical capacity prerequisite explicitly.
  - Physical saved-loadout debug probes need a live inventory capacity preflight before seeding finite items. A character with no cargo-capable clothing/webbing/backpack should make the probe `BLOCKED`, not `FAIL`, because applying loose magazines to an entity with no storage correctly returns `Inventory Full`.
  - After the physical saved-loadout apply, the service refreshes the loadout editor session from the live player. The debug runner can count matching `m_aDraftSlots` and storage-item slot kinds before/apply/restore to prove the server-side editor model reflects the live physical inventory without opening rendered UI.
  - Save/load/reset feedback should be a short-lived in-editor toast, not a global notification. Use a generation token when scheduling delayed clears so an older timer cannot erase a newer prompt. Disabled `Load` buttons should stay visible for empty fixed slots.
  - Loadout candidate icon hints also drive native row previews. Use preview-capable hints such as `medical`, `utility`, and `equipment`; a generic value that the client does not recognize as preview-capable will render as a flat fallback icon even when the prefab can be previewed.
  - Fixed saved loadout slots should be emitted in deterministic slot order from the service payload, including empty slots. A per-slot row can then show both `Save` and `Load`; keep `Load` visible but do not bind a user id when the slot is empty.
  - Per-slot save buttons should send the fixed loadout id such as `slot_0` through the existing `loadout_save` request. The service can treat that argument as a slot target while preserving the old global save behavior for empty arguments.
  - Saved loadout rename/load must stay server-routed through the coordinator. The client can edit a non-empty slot name inline, but the mutation should send `loadout_rename` with `slot_id:name`; load should fail visibly if the serialized native loadout cannot be parsed or applied instead of reporting success.
  - If a button icon is intentionally suppressed in script, also remove the layout fallback text and let the label span the full button. Hidden dynamic widgets can still be visible for a frame during layout debug/initial population, so stale symbols such as the candidate Edit `>` can flash or reserve dead spacing.
  - Loadout editor search should use the full recovered arsenal item arrays (`m_aItem*`), not the selected storage candidate arrays (`m_aCandidate*`). The search result click should send `add_storage_item` with the selected storage node id and prefab; if no storage is selected, show a status and do not issue the request.
  - Storage search category matching should include the raw item category, the slot category label, and the visible storage browser tab label. Grouped tabs such as Weapons and Clothing otherwise will not match items whose raw categories are `weapon`, `launcher`, `headgear`, `vest`, etc.
  - Numeric or short storage searches should match normalized display/category text, not prefab GUID/path noise. Only include prefab paths in search for explicit path-like queries; otherwise strings such as `556` can match unrelated items through resource identifiers instead of user-visible names.
  - Edit-box search inputs can be handled through `ScriptedWidgetEventHandler.OnChange(Widget w, bool finished)` after assigning a stable user id and adding the handler to the `EditBoxWidget`. Remember to clear layout-owned dynamic result containers such as `StorageSearchItems` when reusing the editor root.
  - If an edit-box render path rebuilds dynamic siblings on each query change, restore focus with `WorkspaceWidget.SetFocusedWidget(input, true)` after syncing text and attaching the handler, or continuous typing can stall after the first refresh.

- Dynamic horizontal tabs should be centered by sizing the layout-owned host to the children, not by moving each tab.
  - A tab button with a fixed width and layout padding contributes both to the desired strip width.
  - If the host is wider than the sum of the tab buttons plus their padding, Enfusion lays children from the left and leaves the extra space at the end.
  - Current example: the loadout editor mode tabs use symmetric host insets so the six layout-generated tab buttons sit centered over the left pane.
  - Fixed-size preview boxes inside the candidate header need the same negative far-edge rule as other top/left same-anchor boxes. Positive `OffsetRight` / `OffsetBottom` values produced negative runtime size for the header preview anchor, which made the current equipped item preview disappear.

- `ItemPreviewWidget` does not reliably render every inventory prefab.
  - Keep a category/fallback icon available when prefab or entity preview setup fails.
  - Do not hide the fallback icon just because the entity preview lookup returned null for a non-empty prefab.
  - Empty live equipment nodes still need a visible fallback tile plus `Empty` text; suppressing the fallback makes the header look like a missing render instead of an empty slot.
  - Attachment nodes should resolve their preview icon key as `attachment`, not as slot keys such as `optic` or `muzzle`. Slot keys are useful labels, but they are not in the native-preview eligibility list and will force an equipped attachment preview down the fallback-only path.
  - Attachment slot scans should only treat an attached entity as editable if it has `InventoryItemComponent`. Prefab child props without inventory components, such as structural handguards or fixture meshes, can exist under a weapon slot but should render as empty/non-removable in the loadout editor.
  - Worn clothing Edit means cosmetic/functional attachment-slot editing, not cargo storage editing. Route the equipped clothing item into the existing attachment child-node view; keep cargo insertion/removal in the storage tab.
  - Clothing Edit needs an internal state distinct from weapon attachment editing, while mapping the visible top tab back to Clothing. This prevents Back/click behavior from leaving the player in weapon attachment mode after editing clothing child slots.
  - Clothing attachment discovery should follow broad slot validation: an `AttachmentSlotComponent` with a real attachment slot type is inspectable even if `ShouldShowInInspection()` is false. Recurse child and owned attachment storages, but skip `SCR_UniversalInventoryStorageComponent` cargo storages so inventory pouches do not become cosmetic edit slots.
  - Worn clothing cosmetic slots can be `LoadoutSlotInfo` entries on `ClothNodeStorageComponent`, not only `AttachmentSlotComponent` entries. Treat those loadout child slots as edit nodes for clothing Edit, while continuing to filter structural pouch/scabbard/carrier slots out of add/remove candidate lists.
  - Clothing child-slot candidates should mirror native loadout slot matching: compare the child `LoadoutSlotInfo.GetAreaType().Type().ToString()` with the candidate prefab entity's `BaseLoadoutClothComponent.GetAreaType().Type().ToString()`, then still run the live `CanStoreItem`/`CanReplaceItem` check. Broad arsenal categories are too loose for these slots and can admit unrelated maps, full clothing, or utility items.
  - Spawned clothing/webbing prefabs can carry default stored items inside structural equipment slots. Clean default bayonet contents from those structural slots before insertion or preview, but do not delete the scabbard/carrier shell because it is part of the worn item appearance.
  - When editing clothing attachment children, keep the equipped parent row non-clickable. Clicking the parent while already in its child-node view should not exit into a replacement candidate list.

- Preview camera movement should be intentional.
- Auto-frame the loadout editor preview once when opening or rebuilding the preview world.
- The visible color behind the mannequin comes from the preview stage `MatSkyBox`/`SkyPreset`, not just the `RenderTargetWidget` tint or the decorative sky sphere. Render-background color settings should update the spawned `GenericWorldEntity.GetSkyMaterial()` colors or rebuild the stage with an alternate sky preset.
- Storage selection and storage item add/remove should not invalidate the preview render key or move the camera unless the visible equipped entity actually changes appearance.
- Do not include selected storage-item ids in the preview render key; doing so forces unnecessary clone rebuilds and camera motion while adding repeated inventory contents.
- Non-storage item/node selection should reset the preview camera to the default auto-frame path and use a closer entity framing distance, so choosing a weapon/attachment/clothing edit context does not leave the camera at the previous full-character view. Keep this separate from storage add/remove operations to avoid motion while filling inventories.

- Native input hints should use the widget-library input button components when possible.
  - `SCR_InputButtonComponent` can bind an action name and label to the current input device.
  - Pass configured input action names to `SetAction`, not literal keys. The component resolves the current keyboard, mouse, or controller glyph.
  - Keep generated hint widgets passive with `WidgetFlags.IGNORE_CURSOR | WidgetFlags.NOFOCUS` when they are only visual footer/context hints.
  - Hand-drawn key boxes are useful as fallbacks, but they do not update like native button hints.
  - If a persistent footer or row container is repopulated, clear its child widgets before adding native hint widgets; stale children remain visible even when the backing arrays were cleared.

- Avoid clearing action keys during UI teardown unless that UI will continue owning input for the next frame.
  - `Debug.ClearKey(KeyCode.KC_I)` is acceptable while setup is actively blocking command menu input, but clearing it after setup finalization can consume the first legitimate command-menu open press.
  - Prefer resetting the destination UI input latch and rebinding its input context after a modal/setup screen closes.
  - If a raw key bridge is needed for the destination UI, clear the raw key only after the destination UI actually handles a toggle. A post-setup recovery method can run on the same frame as the user's first real press and eat that press if it calls `Debug.ClearKey` speculatively.

- `ItemPreviewWidget` setup is not proof that a prefab will render useful pixels.
  - Put a category/fallback image behind the native preview widget and keep it visible at low opacity after calling `SetPreviewItemFromPrefab` or `SetPreviewItem`.
  - This preserves a visible row affordance for unsupported prefabs without adding script geometry or hiding native previews that do render.
  - Do not hard-exclude worn equipment categories from native previews. Clothing, storage containers, and weapons should attempt native preview first with the fallback underlay still present, because a visible character item may have a valid preview prefab even if some inventory entries still fall back.
  - For equipped items and live inventory contents, prefer entity previews before prefab previews. Clear the preview widget, then call `SetPreviewItem(previewWidget, entity)`.
  - For arsenal candidates that only have prefab resources, call `SetPreviewItemFromPrefab(previewWidget, prefabResource)` and leave the fallback underlay visible.

- Slot edit remove actions must be independent from compatible replacement candidates.
  - A slot can have a removable equipped item even when the arsenal has no valid replacement entries.
  - Gate the UI remove control on the selected item existing, then let the server-side inventory path reject only truly invalid removals.
  - Header text for an edit context should show the slot/category label and equipped item display name separately; otherwise an equipped item can look like an anonymous preview tile.

- Reused mode panels should hide stale child content on mode reset and re-show the parent before populating.
  - A child such as settings content can remain marked visible while its parent panel is hidden, which makes logs look populated but the screen appear blank.
  - Reset both the parent region and mutually exclusive child panels before rendering the active mode.

- Keep code comments sparse and practical.
  - Comments should capture non-obvious engine constraints, not restate simple assignments.

## Campaign Debug Runners

- Long-running campaign smoke/debug actions should run as a server-side sequencer, not as one huge UI command RPC.
  - The command menu button should start the run or return current status; the coordinator tick should advance one bounded step per second.
  - Keep runner state runtime-only unless the test result itself needs persistence. Do not add fields to save data for a transient debug harness.
  - Current example: `HST_CampaignCoordinatorComponent.RequestAdminRunCampaignDebug()` starts the sequenced campaign debug runner, and `TickCampaignDebugRunner()` advances bootstrap, reports, HQ/spawn, economy/support, phase 0-13 mechanics, mission sweep, phase smoke, and final report stages.
  - Profile selection should be explicit in both runtime status and artifacts. Current campaign debug profiles: `smoke` runs bootstrap/baseline/HQ/economy/final, `physical` adds early mechanics and mission/physical probes while skipping late phase smoke, and `full` runs the complete sequence.
  - Long runs should expose status, cancel, and cleanup admin commands beside the start action. Cancel should stop the sequencer and write artifacts; cleanup should complete the current/early debug missions and clear player-requested support requests.
  - Assign each campaign debug run a deterministic `hst_debug_` marker/mission prefix and record it in status plus artifacts. Retag forced debug-started missions before objective/runtime initialization so derived objective, runtime entity, asset, active group, and marker IDs inherit the prefix and can be cleaned later.
  - Retag debug-created support requests and enemy orders before marker refresh or report generation. Support physicalization derives group IDs from `m_sRequestId`, so prefixing the request before physicalization lets later group and marker cleanup stay deterministic without changing normal gameplay IDs.
  - Prefix cleanup should be narrow and evidence-producing: remove only persisted records whose IDs contain the debug prefix, report before/after/removal counts as typed cleanup metrics, and rebuild campaign markers after marker-backed records change. Do not claim this is a generic world scan for arbitrary untracked physical entities.
  - Defend Petros has static marker IDs (`hst_defend_petros`, `hst_defend_petros_attackers`) linked to dynamic mission/group IDs. Prefix cleanup must clear `m_sDefendPetrosMissionId`, order/support/group links, and the active flag before rebuilding markers; otherwise marker rebuild can recreate static markers that still point at removed debug-prefixed records.

- Campaign debug certification output should be structured first, text second.
  - Workbench can fail with a native crash during Game script validation when large debug-verification probe batches are added, even if repository-side text/brace checks pass. Reintroduce certification slices in small increments and confirm Workbench completes Game script compilation before stacking more probes.
  - A single Workbench log directory can contain several script reload attempts. When auditing a compile failure, split by the latest `Reloading game scripts` / `Script validation` segment before deciding whether an earlier `SCRIPT (E)` line is still current. Record which later reload proves the fix, and keep later commits unproven until they have their own reload/runtime evidence.
  - Keep transient result models outside save data and serialize them with `JsonSaveContext` under `$profile:h-istasi/debug`.
  - Current artifact contract: `HST_CampaignDebug_<runId>.json`, `HST_CampaignDebug_<runId>_summary.txt`, and `HST_CampaignDebug_<runId>_state_diff.txt`.
  - The typed result layer should record run/case/assertion/metric fields, while legacy command/report strings can be wrapped as typed cases during migration.
  - Summary artifacts should derive their feature, mission, physical AI, cleanup, and failure-inspection matrices from typed case results so gaps stay visible instead of being buried in freeform report text.
  - Manual external gaps, such as real process restart, second-client reconnect, and long endurance soak, should be explicit typed WARN cases. Do not wrap them as successful legacy text rows, because the summary needs to show those gaps as incomplete external coverage.
  - State-diff text is enough for forensic triage: capture start and end money, HR, training, war level, active mission, asset, group, support, order, and marker counts.
  - Baseline preflight must include runtime-selected resources, not only definition/catalog resources. The campaign debug preflight should hard-fail if mission runtime prop/vehicle prefabs or AI waypoint prefabs used by primitive services fail `Resource.Load`.
  - Baseline persistence should be a typed case around `HST_PersistenceService.BuildPersistenceReport()`: assert server/member/service readiness, non-empty report text, no failure strings, and explicit native-vs-profile-fallback mode. Native unavailable with profile fallback available is a WARN, not a PASS or a generic failure.
  - Non-legacy typed cases should emit a `post_case_cleanup.*` leak probe while the campaign debug runner is active. The probe should allow the mission intentionally under test and pre-existing active missions captured at run start, then check for unexpected active missions, orphan mission assets, orphan active groups, orphan linked markers, and backing records missing markers.
  - When a phase smoke step has a typed case builder, keep its command/report string as recent-log or case evidence only. Do not also emit a duplicate legacy pass/fail case for the same action; duplicate rows inflate the summary matrix and bypass the typed cleanup model. Current phase smoke uses typed cases for valid indices 0-62, including persistence seed/run/report steps and Phase 20/21 report steps.
  - Debug-only physical entities need a queryable runtime name for final cleanup. `IEntity.SetName()` is available at runtime; set names with `HST_CAMPAIGN_DEBUG` plus the active `hst_debug_` id before relying on the cleanup world scan. The scan must delete only entities whose names contain the explicit debug tag or cleanup prefix, not by broad prefab class.
  - Do not treat a legacy string-wrapped report case as full certification for a feature. Full coverage needs a direct ARRANGE/ACT/OBSERVE/ASSERT/CLEANUP case with state and physical-world evidence, or the feature should remain WARN/BLOCKED/not-covered in the verification audit.

- Physical runtime probes should not silently pass when there is no controlled player entity.
  - Bootstrap should mark a physical-blocked flag if the controlled player cannot be resolved after teleport/spawn setup.
  - `SCR_Global.TeleportPlayer()` can return true before the server-side controlled entity origin reflects the new position in the same script slice. If a debug probe immediately performs distance checks or interactions after teleporting, verify `ResolveControlledPlayerEntity().GetOrigin()` against the resolved ground position and force `SetOrigin()` for the probe when needed.
  - On a dedicated server, a server-side `SCR_Global.TeleportPlayer()`/`SetOrigin()` confirmation is not enough to prove the owning client view moved. Queue an owner RPC on the player-owned request bridge and log the client-side result. The expected proof is a server campaign-debug teleport line with `owner RPC 1` plus a client `h-istasi campaign debug teleport owner ... confirmed 1` line.
  - Continue non-physical state/report checks, but mark convoy, captive, and other physical probes as `BLOCKED` instead of converting missing player context into a pass.
  - HQ runtime checks should read tracked entity handles from `HST_HQService`, not just campaign-state positions. A rebuild case should assert tracked Petros/cache/arsenal/tent/spawn-point runtime keys, their actual positions against expected HQ offsets, per-slot nearby world duplicate counts, and arsenal readiness/action-surface status.
  - The player spawn service submits `SCR_FreeSpawnData` for actual player possession, but the HQ runtime service should still keep a physical FIA spawn-point entity near HQ so the command menu and campaign debug suite can prove the respawn surface exists after HQ rebuilds.
  - While the runner is active, HQ-stage command-menu checks should build the real admin-tab visible payload and assert campaign debug start/status/cancel/cleanup controls are still present, then cross-check command coverage for missing visible/dispatch entries.

- Full-campaign debug coverage should explicitly map to the phase plan instead of assuming late smoke helpers cover everything.
  - Phase 0-13 coverage needs its own sweep for foundation/checkpoint state, mission runtime visibility, convoy route/readiness/waypoint/contact/completion behavior, active-mission persistence, non-convoy primitive runtime, zone activation, garrison recruit/remove, civilian aid, support cancellation, vehicle/loadout actions, and command UI coverage.
  - Phase 0 foundation/checkpoint should remain a typed case, not only a report string: assert active schema/HQ/Petros state, checkpoint acceptance, persistence status evidence, last-save timestamp refresh, captured save snapshot schema/HQ/Petros state, and active mission/group count stability.
  - Phase 1 mission-runtime visibility should remain a typed case, not only concatenated reports: assert mission/UI/runtime/objective service readiness, definition count, report prefixes, explicit zero-active reporting, active mission identity/runtime metadata, fallback/failure warnings, and orphan objective/asset/runtime-entity counts.
  - Early-mechanics steps that already emit typed cases should not also emit generic action/observation classifier cases over the same returned report text. The typed case is the authoritative PASS/WARN/FAIL source; duplicate wrappers can create extra failures from embedded detail text without adding new evidence.
  - Phase 13 primitive sampling should emit a wrapper-level typed case in addition to the primitive-specific physical probe: assert sample mission start, debug-prefix tagging, selected runtime report evidence, primitive metadata, objective/asset/runtime-entity counts, and final succeeded status. Keep captive follow/extraction behavior in the dedicated rescue/captive case.
  - Captive follow probes should use repeated bounded runtime samples after player displacement, not a single tick. Record sample history, best distance, max movement, max distance closed, and fail hard if the captive neither closes distance nor remains near the player before timeout.
  - Mission-sweep start/runtime rows should be typed cases, not legacy result rows. Assert definition metadata, start command acceptance, active mission record, target zone/position, linked marker evidence, objective/asset/runtime-entity counts, runtime primitive/type metadata, clean spawned runtime state, and primitive-specific prerequisites before running the primitive or convoy physical probe.
  - Mission-sweep primitive probes should call the real runtime action path for each primitive, not admin-complete the mission and infer success. Current examples: `kill_hvt` uses `RequestServerMissionAssetDestroyed`, `destroy_target` uses `RequestServerMissionAssetExplosiveDamage`, `rescue_extract` uses the captive interaction probe, and transport primitives use `mission_asset_load` / `mission_asset_deliver` when a nearby carrier can be arranged.
  - Mission-sweep runtime and primitive probes can observe a mission that already completed through the real runtime path before the typed primitive sample runs. If the mission is `SUCCEEDED` and all objectives are complete, record WARN evidence and skip the action instead of failing `active` or looking for already-cleaned assets.
  - Runtime primitive semantics should win over stale or generic objective enum values when mission assets make the outcome unambiguous. Restored or dynamic missions can carry a generic objective type while their primitive and asset role still say `destroy_target`/`destroy_target` or `recover_cargo`/`logistics_cargo`; pollers and counters must count destroyed or delivered assets in those cases.
  - Objective-to-asset role resolution should check explicit target IDs and runtime primitive first, then fall back to the objective enum. Otherwise a generated `CLEAR_AREA` objective for `destroy_target` or `recover_cargo` will look for a hold marker and never complete after the real asset interaction succeeds.
  - Logistics mission completion already pays the configured definition reward shown in mission text. Do not add a hidden hard-coded money/HR bonus from the generic completion outcome unless the reward text and debug assertions are updated to include it.
  - Destroy-target primitive probes must drive every still-unsatisfied role-matching `destroy_target` asset, not only the first asset returned by the mission sweep helper. If the selected asset was already destroyed, tick the normal mission runtime/objective path so asset-backed objective completion can catch up before reward/status assertions.
  - Mission cleanup cases must classify the completion path. `already succeeded` means runtime/probe completion happened before cleanup, `completed 1` from the cleanup command is WARN-only admin cleanup evidence, and `completed 0` is a cleanup failure. Do not use an admin cleanup success row as proof that the physical mission behavior passed.
  - Transport primitive certification depends on a physical carrier near the player. Arrange a temporary vehicle carrier near the pickup point, run the real `mission_asset_load` path, move the carrier/runtime-vehicle record to the delivery point, run `mission_asset_deliver`, then delete the temporary carrier and remove its runtime record. If the carrier cannot be arranged, record the case as `BLOCKED` with the load-command evidence instead of claiming a cargo/reward failure or mutating the asset directly. Natural player driving/path travel remains a separate physical-behavior gap until sampled.
  - Transport primitive probes must deliver every role-matching cargo asset required by the objective, not only the first asset returned by the mission sweep helper. Recover-cargo and supply missions can initialize multiple assets for a single objective count, so completion/reward assertions should run only after the probe has repeatedly moved the same temporary carrier through load/deliver for all undelivered role assets.
  - Mission asset loading uses `HST_MissionRuntimeService.VEHICLE_CARRIER_RADIUS_METERS` (10m), not the looser player asset interaction radius. Debug-created temporary carriers must be placed against the verified current player entity position and remain inside that carrier radius after terrain/vehicle-spawn resolution.
  - `hold_area` and `clear_area` primitive probes should sample a living controlled player inside the objective radius, mission-owned hostile presence/absence, objective hold seconds/world detection, runtime tick completion, rewards, and cleanup. If the probe uses controlled hostile neutralization instead of observed combat, keep that as a WARN so area objective logic is certified without claiming natural combat resolution passed.
  - Phase 12 persistence smoke should seed sentinel state first, then record typed assertions against the actual `HST_CampaignState`: expected-summary task, active smoke missions, convoy and primitive mission matrices, mission assets/runtime entities, garage cargo, support/order sentinels, civilian records, and undercover records. Use `HST_CampaignSaveData.Capture()` plus `Restore()` for an in-memory roundtrip and compare the smoke summary/report/counts between live and restored state.
  - Later phase-persistence smoke runs can legitimately drift from the original expected summary as other phase probes spawn groups, resolve missions, change garrisons, or advance capture progress. Treat a persistence smoke `WARN` report with `missing/zero none` as warning evidence for expected/current drift, not as a failed persistence case. Missing data, duplicate smoke records, or an explicit `FAIL` report remain hard failures.
  - Generated-content debug coverage should assert `HST_CampaignState.m_aGeneratedSites` and `m_aGeneratedRoutes` directly: per-zone primary/roadblock/support/secondary anchors, unique IDs, valid non-zero site positions, source metadata, route links, vehicle-safe routes, at least three waypoints, coherent waypoint indexes, and resolved zone links. Treat `BuildContentReport()` as evidence only.
  - Generated site offsets can land in water or unsafe terrain near coastal zones. Resolve primary/source site anchors through dry safe-ground search around the preferred offset and then the source zone, with a road-safe fallback before accepting the final ground fallback. The road-safe fallback can trust `TryResolveNearestRoadVehiclePosition()` because it already rejects water, narrow roads, and unstable vehicle footprints; repeating `IsDryGroundPosition()` after a successful road resolve can falsely invalidate usable road-side anchors. Resolve generated route waypoints through `TryResolveNearestRoadVehiclePosition()` before falling back to large-vehicle-safe terrain.
  - Generated road-route validation must honor the same road-footprint contract used during route creation. A waypoint snapped by `TryResolveNearestRoadVehiclePosition()` can be valid for routed driving even if the broader `TryResolveLargeVehicleSpawnPosition()` pad check or a separate dry-ground probe fails there; the road resolver already rejects water, narrow roads, and unstable vehicle footprints. Validate road-route waypoints by rechecking nearby road vehicle safety before falling back to large-spawn validation.
  - Generated route repair should not give up after checking only the original bad waypoint. Coastal/offshore offsets can be too far from usable terrain, so retry from the adjacent route destination, the generated route endpoints, and bounded radial candidates around those anchors. Standard `TryResolveVehicleSpawnPosition()` is acceptable as a route-waypoint fallback after road and large-vehicle checks because route waypoints certify passable ground, not a heavy vehicle parking pad.
  - If route generation uses close/medium/far road searches, validation must use an equivalent search radius instead of each mission waypoint's small interaction radius. Otherwise valid generated road waypoints can be reclassified as invalid only because the second pass searched too narrowly.
  - `EnsureGeneratedContent()` must not treat persisted/generated sites and routes as immutable forever. Revalidate saved generated content during foundation setup and regenerate it when per-zone anchors are missing, site validity flags drift from current rules, route links break, or vehicle-route validation fails; otherwise old save state can keep failing new route/site safety checks.
  - Area primitive debug probes should remove the blockers that `PollHoldAreaObjective()` and `PollClearAreaObjective()` actually check, then still run the normal mission runtime/objective tick. That means neutralizing debug mission groups plus nearby hostile active groups, target-zone hostile active groups, and hostile target-zone active/garrison projection before asserting the timed area-control path. Otherwise a player can be inside the radius and hostiles can look cleared for the mission-owned group while the runtime correctly holds progress at contact.
  - Phase 17 capture smoke must not select a zone with an active incomplete `conquest_` mission. `HST_ZoneCaptureService` intentionally caps resistance progress at 90/100 until the conquest objective is complete, so direct force-progress certification should pick a non-gated enemy capturable zone and assert that gate condition before expecting ownership flip and starter FIA garrison creation.
  - The early zone-activation step should exercise the real render-bubble path, not only `SetZoneActive()`: select a non-mission inactive zone with abstract garrison outside the HQ/player bubble, run `HST_PhysicalWarService.UpdateZoneActivation()` with the player far, near, then far again, assert inactive -> active/spawned groups -> inactive cleanup, and restore the selected zone/garrison state. Mission-runtime expired player-bound asset policy should be probed inside `HST_MissionRuntimeService`, because its helpers are protected there: create a debug-prefixed expired rescue mission/asset, assert near-player continuation and interaction eligibility, assert outside-bubble stop/no eligibility, assert player-carrier continuation, then remove temporary records. Convoy-expired contact cleanup policy belongs in `HST_PhysicalWarService`: create temporary debug-prefixed expired convoy contact groups with temporary runtime crew entities, exercise the same preserve/delete branch for only those groups, assert inside-bubble preservation and outside-bubble deletion, then remove temporary records.
  - Render-bubble activation may create active groups whose agent population is still `spawn_pending_agents` on the same script slice. Count pending groups separately and report near-activation as WARN/pending when the zone is active and groups exist but no spawned agents or active-force counts are visible yet.
  - Directly spawned `AIGroup` prefabs can report zero agents on the first one-second callqueue callback, especially while the resource-generation queue is busy. Keep active groups in `spawn_pending_agents` and retry agent counting for a bounded grace window before deleting/folding the runtime entity as a real zero-agent failure.
  - For render-bubble cleanup, sample a short repeated leave window after moving the player outside activation radius. Record sample count, window seconds, max remaining group counts, last observed state, and fail `render_bubble.zone_leave.cleanup_timeout` if active groups or active force counts remain after the full window.
  - Later phase smoke helpers can then focus on the dedicated Phase 14-24 systems, while the final report represents the Phase 25 full-campaign soak summary.
  - Phase 24 typed coverage should assert early/mid/late seeded resource/control profiles, controlled low/mid/high escalation ticks, aggression decay, and forced victory/loss end metadata. Treat long-window autonomous campaign pressure and broad physical follow-on behavior as separate WARN/not-covered gaps until they are sampled over many normal campaign loops.
  - Phase 24 escalation should keep resource-income scaling strict but should not require individual order counts to be monotonic across low/mid/high profiles. Commander ticks spend resources on orders with different costs and duplicate guards; the hard assertion is that each profile creates real orders, while attack/support income deltas prove pressure scaling.
  - Verification audits should distinguish implemented harness coverage from proven full-contract completion. Static code evidence can close wiring and typed assertion gaps, but physical/runtime slices should only be counted as fully closed after a Workbench script reload/runtime run or a generated debug report proves the case passed. Keep natural-behavior, rendered-UI, restart, multiclient, and long-soak requirements as WARN/open until direct evidence exists.
- Dedicated server/client logs are the source of truth for production parity. A Workbench-only green result is not enough for physical AI spawning, player connect/spawn races, custom input routing, marker publication, or setup/active campaign lifecycle behavior; the audit should call out whether evidence came from Workbench or from a dedicated server/client run.
- `HST_CAMPAIGN_SETUP` is a real non-combat phase. The coordinator may tick persistence, setup player-spawn sweeps, setup UI/markers, and campaign-debug control flow, but normal mission/economy/physical-war/civilian/runtime services must not tick until setup confirms HQ deployment and the state reaches `HST_CAMPAIGN_ACTIVE`.
- Physical-war entry points that can spawn or advance runtime groups should defend this contract themselves. `UpdateZoneActivation()`, mission target activation, and mission convoy ticking should return without side effects unless the campaign phase is active, so a missed coordinator guard cannot spawn US/USSR/FIA active groups during HQ selection on a dedicated server.
- Player-controller components cannot rely only on `SCR_PlayerController.GetLocalPlayerId()` during connect/setup transitions. The local id can be late or stale even while `GetGame().GetPlayerController()` and a local controlled entity exist. For client-owned HST controller components, resolve local ownership by checking the native local player controller, the component attached to that controller, the native local player id, and finally `PlayerManager.GetPlayerIdFromControlledEntity(SCR_PlayerController.GetLocalControlledEntity())`.

- Debug runners should accelerate long convoy waits through runtime state, then let normal services process the result.
  - Real convoy staging idle can be several minutes; a one-button test should advance the sample convoy mission counters to the departure threshold and wait a tick or two for mission/physical-war services to move it into the next phase.
  - This exercises the real route/readiness/contact reporting path without making admin diagnostics wait for natural convoy timers.
  - Keep physical convoy internals behind a narrow debug probe API on `HST_PhysicalWarService` instead of widening every runtime helper. The probe can use readiness/progress internals to assert vehicle assets, runtime vehicle entities, crew groups, alive crew, seated drivers, routes, waypoints, and progress samples.
  - Convoy movement proof should include readiness and progress, not just spawned object counts. Treat missing progress samples as WARN while the async runtime catches up, but hard-stuck progress should fail the certification case.
  - For repeated convoy movement proof, let the campaign debug runner wait across real five-second convoy progress intervals after forcing departure. `HST_ConvoyProgressStatus` can then store sample count, max movement, max distance closed, and sampled phase history for the typed probe. Do not synthesize movement in the probe itself; the assertion should report WARN if the engine did not physically move far enough during the window.
  - Convoy phase-chain assertions should distinguish evidence levels: travel evidence can come from sampled `convoy_moving`/`convoy_contact`/terminal phases or the final mission phase, contact-or-terminal evidence should remain WARN until contact/arrival/elimination is observed, and terminal evidence should stay WARN unless `convoy_arrived` or `convoy_eliminated` is actually sampled or final.
  - A separate controlled convoy phase-chain probe can prove the state-machine helper contract by creating temporary debug convoy records, calling `UpdateMissionConvoyPhase`, `SetMissionConvoyMoving`, `SetMissionConvoyContact`, and `UpdateMissionConvoyObjective`, then cleaning those records. Keep this evidence labeled as controlled state-machine coverage; it must not replace natural physical-driving movement samples or the live arrival/failure path.
  - A fully sampled convoy movement window with no vehicle movement, no destination-distance closure, no recovery attempt, and no contact/arrival/elimination phase progress is a real `convoy.movement.stall_timeout` FAIL only after the sampled window reaches the convoy recovery/reissue threshold. Short repeated samples before that threshold should remain WARN/pending with evidence, because recovery cannot have fired yet.

- POW/captive debug certification should use the real interaction commands.
  - For `rescue_extract`, call `mission_captive_extract` first; that path frees an unpicked captive and marks the asset picked up.
  - Then call `mission_captive_follow`; the expected state is `m_sLastInteraction == "following"`, `m_bAttachedToCarrier == true`, and a non-empty carried-by identity.
  - Checking only mission text or spawned captive asset counts does not prove the rescue primitive can move from freed to following/extracting.
  - A full rescue probe should iterate every required captive asset, use the same free/follow interaction path, teleport the debug player to the asset delivery target, and call `mission_captive_extract` again for each attached captive. Assert delivered counts, `m_iExtractedCaptiveCount`, mission success, alive/not-destroyed captives, and exact money/HR reward deltas.
  - A synchronous debug helper can tick `HST_MissionRuntimeService` after moving the player to prove the follow link survives and the follow controller/waypoint path is processed. Do not hard-pass physical distance closure unless the measured captive position actually moves closer; AI walking may need real frame time beyond a single script tick.
  - If the captive remains attached/following and inside the follow break range but does not physically close distance during the synchronous sample window, record WARN timing evidence instead of FAIL. A broken follow link or out-of-range captive remains a real failure.
  - To certify captive vehicle boarding without mutating the real rescue mission, create a debug-prefixed temporary captive asset/runtime entity and a temporary carrier, call the same `TryMoveCaptiveIntoVehicle` helper used by normal follow updates, then assert `SCR_CompartmentAccessComponent` seat/getting-in state and loaded carrier state. Cleanup should call `GetOutVehicle(EGetOutType.TELEPORT, -1, ECloseDoorAfterActions.INVALID, false)` when seated, delete the runtime entity/carrier, and remove temporary mission asset/runtime records before recording the case result.

- Player-requested support cooldowns can poison later support smoke steps.
  - Stage 3 economy income certification should use `HST_TownService.CalculateResistanceIncome()` and `CalculateResistanceHRIncome()` after arranging a resistance-owned income zone, then assert exact money/HR deltas from the real `income_now` command. Record occupier/invader income potential separately so enemy-owned zones are proven excluded from player income. Treat the income report string as evidence only.
  - If an earlier debug stage calls player support commands, clear or cancel player-requested support requests and reset their cooldown fields before Phase 19 support smoke helpers.
  - Otherwise a valid support smoke command can fail for a cooldown created by the same one-button debug run.
  - When a debug suite intentionally tests several support types in one run, clear/cancel the previous player support request before each support-type probe. Then assert the newly created `HST_SupportRequestState` fields (`m_eType`, `m_sFactionKey`, target zone/position, ETA, money cost, queued/active status) instead of relying on the command text.
  - Support cancellation probes should capture the cancellation status/resolution before cleanup, then run player-support cleanup and assert no queued/active player support or cooldown remains. A cancelled row can remain as history, but it must not poison later support requests in the same debug run.
  - For QRF/search player support certification, push the debug-created request to the inbound physicalization window and tick `HST_SupportRequestService` instead of calling abstract completion directly. Assert remaining ETA decreases, runtime status advances, `m_bPhysicalized` flips, `m_sGroupId` is populated, and the linked active group has a support runtime status. Then sample `HST_PhysicalWarService.UpdateRoutedActiveGroupsNow()` across repeated route windows and report sample count, movement count, distance-closure count, max movement, max distance closed, and last-observed/stall history. After controlled arrival, a debug-owned support group can be moved to a terminal runtime status to prove `physical_group_terminal` resolution through the real support tick; keep natural support contact/combat as a separate gap until sampled without forcing the terminal state. Remove/cancel the debug support group/request before the post-case leak probe.
  - Route-based physical probes should distinguish missing samples from sampled stalls. If a ground support or enemy-order group is sampled through the controlled route window and shows no movement, no distance closure, and no arrival status, record a `*.physical_stall_timeout` FAIL with timeout seconds, last-observed status, and sample history. Missing or insufficient samples can remain WARN/BLOCKED depending on prerequisite state, but a fully sampled no-progress window is a real failure.
  - Route-based physical probes should not fail movement or stall-timeout assertions when the sampled group is already within the target-distance tolerance. Distance closure is only meaningful while the group is still away from its objective; `distance_after <= 25m` is non-stall evidence even if the runtime status has not yet flipped to arrived.
  - Do not classify `spawn_pending_agents` or `convoy_seating_pending` as a route stall just because the debug runner advanced campaign seconds. Those states depend on real engine/callqueue population or animated boarding; keep them as WARN/pending evidence until the pending state clears, then fail only fully sampled no-progress windows.
  - Civilian aid debug probes should assert the exact clamped `RegisterIncident` result, not only direction. For the current aid command this means money -100, FIA support +12 clamped to 100, occupier support -6 clamped to 0, reputation +12 clamped to 100, wanted heat -2 floored at 0, and zone support clamped to the FIA-minus-occupier difference.
  - Civilian aid target selection must resolve an actual `HST_CivilianZoneState`/town zone near HQ. Reusing a generic support-zone selector can pick a depot/resource zone, where `RegisterIncident()` correctly returns false because civilian incidents only apply to town records.
  - Early garrison recruit/remove probes should arrange a non-active resistance-owned zone with real garrison slots, assert exact infantry/money/HR deltas through the public command paths, then restore temporary owner/active flags and remove an empty garrison record if the probe created one from nothing.
  - Phase 14 arsenal smoke should assert the `HST_ArsenalItemState` records directly. Finite-only mission props should create counted but locked records, threshold props should unlock at the configured count, blocked props should fail `CanDepositItem`, and raw visual/support assets should not create arsenal rows. Treat the report text as evidence, not as the pass/fail source.
  - Phase 15 garage/source smoke should prefix debug-created `HST_GarageVehicleState.m_sVehicleId` values during the one-button runner, assert stored cargo and source metadata directly, and include prefixed garage vehicles in cleanup/counting. Without that, source-vehicle smoke can leave persistent garage rows that the normal debug-prefix cleanup never sees.
  - Early garage/loadout certification should drive the real garage store/redeploy/capture commands and track the runtime vehicle id created by redeploy. Garage redeploy runtime ids are engine-derived rather than debug-prefixed, so the probe must capture or otherwise despawn the physical vehicle and remove the exact runtime/cargo records it created.
  - Workbench player prefabs can expose an inventory manager while still having no cargo insertion target for loose magazines. Physical saved-loadout probes should try a temporary storage carrier first; if neither loose cargo nor carrier insertion is possible, report the physical reflection branch as environment WARN while keeping serialized apply/ledger assertions authoritative.
  - Early command UI coverage can reuse the Phase 23 command/menu assertion helpers, but should still record an `early_mechanics` typed case so the phase 0-13 sweep is not represented only by a legacy text wrapper.
  - Phase 16 garrison/training smoke should capture before/after observations around the real recruitment/training service calls. Assert the selected zone is resistance-owned/inactive, the abstract garrison record changed by the requested infantry within slot capacity, zero-cost smoke actions did not spend money/HR, and training either increments once or reports a max-level no-mutation warning.
  - Phase 17 capture/counterattack smoke should remember the seeded capture zone and reuse it for force-progress and counterattack checks. Prefix only counterattack orders created during the debug run, assert ownership/progress/garrison/order/marker state directly, then physicalize the order through the real enemy commander/support path and sample repeated routed active-group movement/distance-closure/stall history. If the linked counterattack group is still in `spawn_pending_agents` during the same debug slice, report that as WARN/pending evidence just like Phase 22 Petros attack and support probes; fail only once the async population window has cleared. Keep multi-wave/contact/arrival/resolution behavior as a separate gap until those transitions are sampled.
  - `HST_PhysicalWarService.UpdateRoutedActiveGroupsNow()` owns runtime group entity ensure, survivor refresh, and routed active-group updates. `UpdateZoneActivation()` should call it before zone activation/deactivation, and debug physical probes should call the route-only wrapper so support/QRF groups can advance without folding the target zone during measurement.
  - Phase 18/19 smoke assertions should verify debug-prefixed enemy order/support records, expected types, target zones/positions, resource cost fields, and resolve/ETA behavior. Stage 3 QRF/search support now samples repeated route advances, controlled ETA arrival, and controlled physical terminal resolution; keep Phase 19 enemy/support contact behavior as WARN/separate probes until those paths are sampled over time.
  - Phase 18 background-war coverage should seed resistance/occupier/invader POI ownership, top up enemy pools, run the real commander tick threshold, prefix the resulting orders, and assert both occupier and invader order evidence. This proves one controlled command-selection tick; it does not replace long-window escalation or physical advance sampling.
  - Phase 18 background-war commander probes must resolve pre-existing open enemy orders before measuring new order creation. The commander intentionally skips duplicate active orders for a faction/target-zone pair, so stale Phase 17/18 orders can otherwise hide one faction's expected controlled order.
  - Phase 24 escalation pressure should reuse the Phase 18 background-war seed, then run separate low/mid/high profiles with exact enemy pool baselines. Capture pool totals before the resource tick, after `HST_EnemyDirectorService.TickResources()`, and after `HST_EnemyCommanderService.Tick()` so resource-income scaling is not confused with commander spending. Resolve open orders between profiles to avoid duplicate-order guards, prefix newly created orders/support/groups, and keep support/group physicalization as evidence or WARN unless movement is sampled.
  - Phase 24 can cover a short repeated background-war window by running several normal resource/commander tick intervals after seeding the same POI ownership graph. Resolve debug-created open orders between cycles so duplicate-order guards do not hide later commander decisions, retag every created order with the active run prefix, and assert repeated resource ticks, repeated commander ticks, created order counts, and no open prefixed orders after the controlled cycle cleanup. This is stronger than a single commander tick, but it is still not a substitute for an extended autonomous soak across many POIs.
  - Phase 24 pacing seeds are economy/end-state probes, not HQ-threat probes. Reset HQ knowledge/threat/last attack state during those debug seeds so a prior Phase 22 Petros-defense sample cannot spawn a new Defend Petros mission and contaminate pacing cleanup assertions.
  - Aggression decay certification should set a known aggression value on every non-resistance pool, reset the aggression accumulator, tick exactly one configured decay interval, and assert the total decrease equals `decayAmount * enemyPoolCount` without underflow.
  - Phase 20 town support smoke should drive the real `HST_CivilianService.RegisterIncident()` path in both directions, then restore the seeded town state before the runner continues. Assert FIA/occupier support direction, `HST_ZoneState.m_iSupport == clamp(FIA - occupier)`, support/reputation/heat bounds, incident metadata, support-only owner flips, zone marker model owner/color/style reflection, and cleanup restore. With a preset supplied, town incidents flip from enemy ownership to resistance when FIA support is at least 65, FIA leads occupier support by at least 15, and wanted heat is at most 5; resistance-owned towns flip back to an enemy faction when occupier support is at least 65 with a 15-point lead or wanted heat is at least 15 while occupier support exceeds FIA support. The debug probe must restore owner, capture progress, support, heat, incident/security metadata, undercover restriction state, and the rebuilt zone marker model after sampling both directions.
  - Phase 20 wanted-heat smoke should include a copied-state heat-decay probe through `HST_CivilianService.Tick()`. Use a temporary `HST_CampaignState` with copied town/player records, advance it by `HST_CivilianService.HEAT_DECAY_SECONDS`, and assert town heat decreases by exactly one while the town incident timestamp advances. The current player undercover heat behavior cools by one eligible civilian-service tick once the player is not still compromised; record that current behavior directly instead of silently treating it as the same town-window timer. Assert the live campaign town/player records remain unchanged after the copied-state probe. This certifies heat decay logic, not a broader civilian reaction state machine.
  - Phase 20 civilian population smoke should use the scoped `HST_CivilianService.UpdatePhysicalTownPopulationForZone()` helper for a selected inactive town. The global population tick can spawn or clean other active towns, which makes a one-case assertion harder to cleanly restore. Assert live CIV character/vehicle counts, CIV faction tags, spawn radius, spawn-failure delta, bounded movement samples from runtime spawn positions, and cleanup of runtime entities plus transient runtime-vehicle records.
  - A scoped civilian population update returning `false` is not by itself a failed activation. If the runtime town record exists and live CIV runtime entities were spawned, treat the population as active and record the no-delta update as evidence.
  - Civilian population runtime currently owns spawn/cleanup/diagnostics, not a service-level waypoint or reaction state machine. A debug movement probe can sample `IEntity.GetOrigin()` against the stored spawn position and report moved-count/max-distance/timeout evidence, but static civilians should remain WARN evidence until a real civilian behavior contract exists.
  - Phase 21 undercover apply smoke needs a controlled eligibility fixture. Normal player requests should validate the live entity, but the admin smoke can use `BuildUndercoverEligibility(..., checkCurrentEntity = false)` after seeding clean town/player heat so Workbench's military player prefab does not make the apply path fail before exposure scans are tested. Reset transient player heat, compromise timeout, detection source/score, last scan failures, and cached eligibility reasons before calling the real request; stale roadblock/police evidence from earlier smoke steps should not poison the apply fixture.
  - Phase 22 HQ/Defend Petros smoke should assert the state chain, not only the command text: seeded HQ knowledge/threat reasons, a debug-prefixed Petros attack order, a debug-prefixed dynamic defense mission/objective/task, active defense markers, linked support request evidence, repeated routed attacker-group movement/distance-closure/stall history, admin-success resolution, Petros death/runtime-object clearing, and debug recovery. Prefix the defense mission before objective/task creation so cleanup can remove the whole record chain; retag a later physical support request before it spawns a group. Keep multi-wave/contact/arrival/defense pressure as WARN until those transitions are sampled over time.
  - Petros attack orders are attacks on the resistance base, not the nearby strategic zone used as routing/source context. Keep the zone ID for support source lookup and duplicate-order guards, but set `m_vTargetPosition` to `m_vPetrosPosition`/`m_vHQPosition`, make notifications/reports/support markers describe the target as `HQ/Petros`, and assert order/support/group/mission/objective/task positions against the base position instead of the zone center.
  - Campaign victory/loss should terminally resolve an active Defend Petros chain without awarding mission rewards: close the dynamic defense mission/task/objective, resolve the Petros order, cancel linked support, fold the attacker group, and clear the active flag so terminal campaign state does not preserve a live base-defense mission. Coordinator ownership/capture wrappers must run this cleanup after calling strategic zone-owner helpers because those helpers can apply campaign end internally.
  - Petros attack support has a stricter HQ standoff than generic support staging. Resolve staged/arrived positions with a Petros-specific margin and reject fallback positions against the Petros attack standoff, not just the smaller HQ safe radius, or physicalization can fail with `physicalize_failed_hq_standoff` before an attacker group exists.
  - Any Phase 22 debug command that creates or reuses a Petros attack order must apply the current campaign-debug order prefix before `EnsureDefendPetrosMissionForOrder()` links state. `queue attack` and `start defense` can create orders through different paths; both must retag or cleanup/report assertions will see unprefixed `order_<faction>_<time>_<index>` records.
  - Phase 23 UI/marker smoke should assert command/menu and marker state directly: no `missing visible command:` or `missing dispatch:` detail rows, admin menu strings for campaign-debug and Phase-23 controls, every `hst_zone_<zoneId>` marker model entry with linked ID, owner, color, style, and position matching the current `HST_ZoneState`, HQ/mission/support/QRF marker coverage from `HST_CampaignState.m_aMapMarkers`, and marker/backing-state consistency via the same helpers used by post-case cleanup. The native marker report should rebuild markers before reporting, then assert native eligible/published/skipped/failed/pending counters and tracked static handle liveness through structured service getters instead of string parsing. Failed-action samples should snapshot state before and after invalid commands so they prove reasoned failure with no campaign mutation. Native map-marker manager absence should be explicit WARN/report evidence; visual widget inspection still requires a separate UI/render probe.
  - Marker/backing consistency probes should force `RefreshCampaignMarkers()` before counting missing backing markers. Mission/support/QRF creation often sets marker-refresh-needed flags and relies on the normal tick throttle, so checking `m_aMapMarkers` first can produce stale post-case cleanup WARNs even though the marker service can rebuild the correct backing records immediately.
  - A mission can be correctly represented by a specific objective/asset marker instead of its generic mission marker. `HST_MapMarkerService.AddMissionMarkers()` suppresses the base `mission.m_sMarkerId` when a visible mission asset or objective marker exists, so debug marker/backing verification must accept any visible marker linked to the mission instance.
  - Zone marker position assertions should compare X/Z placement with a small tolerance, not exact 3D vector equality. `HST_MapMarkerService.AddMarker()` resolves marker presentation height through `ResolveGroundPosition()`, so marker Y can differ from `HST_ZoneState.m_vPosition[1]` even when the marker is correctly placed on the map.

  - Campaign-debug generic command outputs and read-only report snapshots should use typed `action.*` and `observation.*` cases instead of the `legacy.*` text wrapper. These cases should record the full text as evidence, assert non-empty output, and run the normal failure-string classifier as an assertion so generic rows appear in matrices without claiming feature-specific physical coverage.

- A one-button debug run can cover in-process Phase 25 soak checks, but not external session conditions.
  - An in-memory `HST_CampaignSaveData` restore is useful certification evidence for copied state shape, but it is not a substitute for a process restart, second-client reconnect, or long soak.
  - Field-vehicle persistence smoke can seed a restore-eligible `field_vehicle` runtime record and prove it survives `HST_CampaignSaveData` capture/restore exactly once. Keep this labeled as record-level restore evidence; physical vehicle respawn through `HST_LootService.RestorePersistentFieldVehicles()` still needs real world/process restore evidence before it can be counted as complete.
  - Report real restart-after-each-primitive, second-client join/reconnect, and two-hour endurance as explicit WARN/manual gaps instead of silently treating them as covered.
  - Keep the rest of the Phase 25 summary tied to actual counters from the sequenced run: early phase steps, mission definitions, Phase 14-24 smoke steps, and aggregate pass/warn/fail totals.

- Generated alpha content must not retain invalid anchor positions.
  - `HST_GeneratedContentService` should repair generated mission sites to accepted dry/road/vehicle-safe positions before insertion. If a zone anchor itself is unusable, search around linked zones before falling back to the original position.
  - Route validation should attempt to repair unsafe waypoints with a wider road/large-vehicle search before marking the route invalid; otherwise coastal or offshore source anchors can poison the whole generated-content smoke case even when nearby linked land anchors exist.

- A destructive full-campaign runner that calls member/commander APIs must normalize the clicking admin's authority for the run.
  - Admin status alone does not imply commander status. Temporarily make the actor member/commander while the runner executes, then restore the previous commander identity on completion.
  - This avoids false failures in commander-gated systems such as HQ rebuild, income, training, and support requests.
  - Bootstrap evidence should record the debug actor's backend UUID, SteamID64, and admin grant reason. Treat missing SteamID64 settings proof as WARN when the actor is already admin by another path, not PASS.

- Player identity for h-istasi state and admin configuration use different durable IDs.
  - `PlayerId=2` is only a per-session connection id; it can change on reconnect and should not be stored in `membership.adminIdentityIds`.
  - `membership.adminIdentityIds` should only contain raw 17-digit SteamID64 values. Do not store backend UUIDs, `workbench_player_N`, prefixed aliases, or session player ids there.
  - On the server, `GetGame().GetBackendApi().GetPlayerPlatformId(playerId)` is the intended script-side platform-id source for matching the SteamID64 value and should be proved in h-istasi grant logs. If that path does not match, log the backend UUID, platform-id candidate, and configured admin count before assuming the settings token is wrong.
  - `GetGame().GetBackendApi().GetPlayerIdentityId(playerId)` returns the backend UUID shown in backend/network logs after authentication. Use that UUID for internal persistent player/member/commander state, with `workbench_player_N` only as a local/early bootstrap placeholder, not as an admin fallback.
  - If a player was registered before the backend identity was available, migrate the placeholder record and rewrite commander/loadout/undercover owner references once the UUID resolves.
  - Server-host admin lists can be bridged through the session player id after connection: use `SCR_PlayerListedAdminManagerComponent.GetInstance().IsPlayerOnAdminList(playerId)` or `BackendApi.IsListedServerAdmin(playerId)` for runtime admin grants, but do not persist the session id as the durable h-istasi identity. This is a separate native-server admin source, not a third `membership.adminIdentityIds` token type.
  - Runtime settings parsing must handle `adminIdentityIds` as either a compact one-line JSON array or a pretty-printed multi-line JSON array. The profile file can be reformatted by external tools; a line-only parser will silently clear the configured admin list.

- The `I` key is already present in the base input config as native action `PlayerMenuInvite` under `PlayerMenuContext`.
  - The h-istasi command menu can keep its custom `HST_CommandMenu` action/binding, but the client component should also activate `PlayerMenuContext`, activate `PlayerMenuInvite`, listen for `PlayerMenuInvite`, and include that native action state in input heartbeat logs.
  - Petros/HQ contextual actions call the same menu renderer; log those opens as `contextual action` so they are not mistaken for successful `I` key opens.
  - Treat `h-istasi menu | native I action input detected source=PlayerMenuInvite ...` followed by `h-istasi menu debug | opened via native PlayerMenuInvite` as proof that the native `I` path reached and opened the HST command menu. If a player reports the key still failing, first confirm a newer client log exists and check for setup/UI-root/debounce refusal lines before changing input bindings.

- Full-campaign debug report classification must not scan stale aggregate text as if it belonged to the current action.
  - Mission-sweep runtime checks should inspect the selected mission instance, then append selected convoy diagnostics only for that mission. Global mission runtime reports include completed/failed historical mission records and can poison every later mission with old `failed:` text.
  - Diagnostic report steps should be judged by report availability/admin errors, not by generic action failure substrings. Summaries such as `missing dispatch 0`, expected Defend Petros failure text, or historical support/order failure reasons are useful diagnostics, not proof that the current report step failed.
  - UI coverage reports should only fail on explicit detail rows such as `missing visible command:` or `missing dispatch:`, not on the zero-count summary labels.
  - Baseline persistence diagnostics should distinguish a broken save path from an unavailable native backend with a working profile fallback. In Workbench, `PersistenceSystem unavailable` plus `profile fallback 1` is a warning-level environment limitation; failed fallback save/load/read or `profile fallback false` is a real failure.
  - Keep the baseline persistence check focused on `HST_PersistenceService.BuildPersistenceReport()`. Do not append the unseeded persistence-smoke report there; the dedicated seeded persistence smoke steps own that validation later in the run.

- Convoy mission runtime should not fall back to a generic mission prop when convoy vehicle asset planning fails.
  - A convoy with `spawned 1` and `vehicle asset count 0` is misleading: the physical convoy did not exist even though the generic runtime prop spawned.
  - Keep the convoy unspawned, preserve `m_sRuntimeFailureReason`, and log the road/destination/slot-plan reason so the next debug run shows whether the blocker is destination road resolution, the 2000-5000m band, full-column slot probing, or vehicle footprint checks.
  - Convoy start planning should keep the 2000-5000m road-resolved band, but synthetic radial probes are not enough near sparse road/coastal regions. If random band probes miss the road network, try known generated route anchors across the campaign state as fallback start candidates, then still run the same road, clearance, band, and full-column slot checks before creating vehicle assets.
  - Convoy vehicle spawn and AI crew population are asynchronous. If an AIGroup initially has zero agents, preserve `spawn_pending_agents` while the convoy vehicle is spawned; otherwise the delayed population callback will skip the group and the convoy health check can fail immediately with `Convoy could not spawn three crewed vehicles.` even though the agents were still inside the population grace window.
  - When the delayed AIGroup population callback does find agents for a convoy crew group, immediately retry the convoy vehicle binding path. The normal spawn path may already have both crew and vehicle runtime handles, so a handle-missing respawn check will not necessarily revisit seating by itself.
  - Convoy crew control has two async windows: population and vehicle seating. Dedicated-server logs can show direct fallback crew agents populated, followed by `convoy_seating_pending` while Enfusion animates boarding or driver assignment. During a short seating grace, do not treat `CountAliveRuntimeCrewAgents() == 0` as combat contact or `convoy_eliminated`; keep contact/survivor/readiness assertions pending/WARN until the grace expires.
  - Convoy debug readiness assertions should respect `m_bPendingGrace`: missing seated drivers, routes, or waypoints during the staging grace are WARN evidence for async crew boarding, not hard failures. Apply the same rule to per-group `convoy.group_waypoints.*` assertions when the active group is still in `convoy_seating_pending`; after the grace expires, the same missing readiness fields are real convoy failures.
  - Per-asset convoy physical assertions must also respect the same pending window. A missing `convoy.crew_entity.*` handle is WARN while `BuildMissionConvoyReadinessStatus()` reports pending grace or `IsConvoyCrewControlPending()` is true, then becomes FAIL after the population/seating window expires.
  - Generic convoy failure logs should include group context: vehicle asset count, attempted/spawned groups, pending control count, alive crew groups/count, runtime handle counts, and one sample group status/reason. The one-line warning should be enough to tell whether the failure was asset planning, pending AI population/seating, missing handles, no living crew, or vehicle binding.
  - Convoy completion must not infer `all crews eliminated` from missing runtime handles, pending population/seating control, or zero live count during the pending window. Count missing and pending crew groups separately and only complete on elimination when the crew runtime was observable or explicitly terminal.
  - A campaign-debug convoy physical probe should force a narrow `EnsureMissionConvoyRuntimeNow()` service pass for that mission before asserting physical readiness. Otherwise the probe can sample stale mission state immediately before the normal physical-war tick would have created or repaired runtime handles.
  - Campaign-debug convoy physical case ids should include the runner label/window. The same convoy mission can be sampled during movement/readiness and later during contact; those are distinct evidence windows and should not produce duplicate case ids.

- Runtime tracking arrays must stay lockstep.
  - When maintaining parallel arrays such as runtime group ids/entities, runtime vehicle group ids/entities, pending population ids/status/group/state, or blocked vehicle zone ids/reasons, remove sibling arrays at the target index before removing the key/id array. Removing the key first can make `i < sibling.Count()` false for the final element and leave orphan handles or reasons shifted out of alignment.

- Campaign-debug cleanup assertions should test ownership/backing, not raw count drift.
  - A long full-profile run can legitimately leave backed, non-debug active groups created by normal campaign services. Treat total active-group count as a metric/context line. The hard cleanup invariant is no `hst_debug_` prefixed state and no active group lacking zone, mission, support, enemy-order, or QRF backing.

- Terminal campaign phases need special runner handling.
  - If `EOnFrame` returns early for `HST_CAMPAIGN_WON` or `HST_CAMPAIGN_LOST`, tick the debug runner before returning or a forced victory/loss step can strand the sequence.
  - Do not auto-repair won/lost back to active before reading the campaign-end report steps. Let the forced loss/victory helpers reset state when they need to set up their own terminal scenario.
  - Phase 24 post-end checks should snapshot state immediately after forced victory/loss, then compare the following delayed report step. Assert elapsed seconds, mission/objective/asset/support/order/group/runtime-vehicle counts, money, HR, and income timer are unchanged to prove the terminal frame branch skipped normal campaign services.
  - After the debug runner purges native/static markers or removes debug-prefixed state, force an immediate player-marker refresh/reconcile before reporting completion. The player marker service can legitimately clear dynamic markers during transient no-player respawn slices, but completion should leave a live desired/tracked player marker for manual map inspection. Bypass the cached player-marker reconcile signature for this completion refresh and record desired/tracked/live counts in the run artifact so a missing post-run map marker is visible in structured evidence.
  - `m_bHQRuntimeObjectsSpawned` describes live entity handles, not durable campaign data. Save capture/restore should force it false, and the terminal-frame branch should still call the HQ runtime-object rebuild so a persisted won/lost debug save can show Petros, cache, arsenal, tent, and spawn point without resuming normal campaign services.
  - HQ/Petros access needs an object fallback, not only the Petros character or the `I` key. The July 2026 server/client logs showed the HQ arsenal survived and opened the loadout editor while Petros/runtime command access was missing, so keep an HQ menu user action on the arsenal and keep the arsenal action filter aware of all h-istasi custom actions.

- Aggregate debug results should separate action assertions from diagnostic reports.
  - Score mutation/test commands through a shared failure classifier (`failed:`, server/admin required, not-ready, `FAIL` smoke output).
  - Log read-only reports as INFO unless the report itself is empty or indicates a hard service failure.
  - Intentional negative-path samples, such as the Phase 23 failed-action sample, should count as PASS only when the expected commands fail with explicit reason text and before/after mutation snapshots stay equal. The negative path itself is not warning-worthy; missing failure text or silent state mutation is a real FAIL.
  - Phase 20/21 undercover smoke should assert `HST_PlayerUndercoverState` directly. Useful fields are `m_eStatus`, `m_iWantedHeat`, `m_bUndercoverRequested`, `m_bUndercoverApplied`, `m_sAppliedMode`, `m_sLastDetectionSource`, roadblock/police scan counts, and last scan failure booleans.

## AI And Spawning

- Native `SCR_FreeSpawnData` requests require a fully available player controller.
  - `SCR_RespawnComponent` can be obtainable while `PlayerManager.GetPlayerController(playerId)` still returns null during a connect/setup race. Submitting a native free-spawn request in that window can produce `SCR_FreeSpawnHandlerComponent.AssignEntity_S` VM exceptions on `playerController.GetControlledEntity()`.
  - Gate both setup-holding and active FIA spawn requests on `GetPlayerController(playerId)` before calling `RequestSpawn`; retry on later spawn sweeps instead of treating this as a hard failure.

- Standalone HQ NPC runtime handles need recovery and preparation.
  - A bare character prefab can spawn successfully and still be gone from service tracking by the next HQ lifecycle tick. Before spawning another Petros, scan near the intended HQ/Petros position for an existing matching prefab and reattach the service handle.
  - Immediately after spawn or reattach, set a stable entity name, visible/traceable/active flags, FIA faction, origin, and disabled movement/weapon controls so Petros behaves like a stationary HQ NPC instead of a normal player-controlled spawn candidate.
  - Petros runtime proof must be the real Petros character, not the HQ action surface/tent/cache. Spawn a `{000CD338713F2B5A}Prefabs/AI/Groups/Group_Base.et` root for Petros, set it FIA, disable delete-when-empty, then call `SCR_AIGroup.AddAIEntityToGroup(petros)`. HQ runtime tracking should require both the Petros entity and the Petros AIGroup handle so the debug suite cannot pass on an invisible fallback anchor.
  - If a grouped Petros character disappears without an HST clear path, log the removal and retry a real grouped spawn. Do not mark the HQ runtime complete until the character itself is tracked again.

- `AIGroup` prefab spawning is not necessarily populated on the same frame as `SpawnEntityPrefab`.
  - Native/editor logs can report that a group prefab was spawned while its agents are still invisible or pending creation.
  - h-istasi mission/physical-war spawning should keep the existing population grace/polling path before declaring a group failed. The July 2026 logs showed HST-spawned groups reporting zero agents first and then later folding/populating correctly.
  - `SCR_AIGroup.GetOnAllDelayedEntitySpawned()` is the native signal that the delayed member-spawn list drained. Subscribe to it for pending groups and use the event to retry the live-agent count early, while keeping a timed retry fallback because navmesh/AI budget failures can still drain the list without immediately yielding countable agents.
  - On a dedicated server, the delayed-spawn event can drain with zero agents and no useful engine warning. Once `SCR_AIGroup.IsInitializing()` is false and the group still reports zero agents, physical-war groups should fall back to direct faction infantry character spawning, set the intended `FactionAffiliationComponent`, call `SCR_AIGroup.AddAIEntityToGroup(member)`, and track those members under the same runtime group id for cleanup.
  - A native delayed `SCR_AIGroup` can call `EndDelayedSpawn()` with zero agents and schedule `SCR_EntityHelper.DeleteEntityAndChildren(this)` through its delete-when-empty path. Do not add direct fallback infantry into that empty native group after this point; replace the root with fresh `Group_Base`, remove the delayed-spawn callback, stamp the intended faction, and then add direct members. Otherwise the fallback members can exist for one proof line and vanish before the next survivor tick.
  - Do not wait forever for `SCR_AIGroup.IsInitializing()` to clear. The July 5 server debug log showed valid empty group prefabs staying initializing through every one-second retry; after a bounded retry threshold, force the direct faction-infantry fallback anyway. If `AddAIEntityToGroup()` still fails, then the group can remain pending or fail at the final retry.
  - Group/entity faction metadata must be stamped explicitly after runtime spawn. Set `SCR_AIGroup.SetFaction(faction)` for group-prefab roots, then verify/apply `FactionAffiliationComponent.SetAffiliatedFactionByKey(factionKey)` on controlled agents and direct fallback members. Also stamp active vehicle and convoy vehicle entities. Prefab defaults can otherwise leak into map/editor presentation and make non-FIA AI appear as FIA even when the selected prefab list was correct.
  - Keep a runtime faction reconciliation pass for active groups. If later delayed agents, direct fallback members, or vehicle entities appear after initial spawn, restamp them before survivor counting and log persistent faction mismatches with expected faction, group id, source, mismatch count, and sample position.
  - When direct fallback members are tracked beside their parent `AIGroup`, counting must not double-count. Treat a positive `AIGroup.GetAgentsCount()` as the source of truth; only count tracked member entities directly while the group reports zero agents.
  - Prefer faction infantry character prefabs from `HST_DefaultCatalog.CreateFactionTemplate(factionKey)` for fallback members. Do not reuse group prefabs or generic FIA defaults for all sides, or server runs can appear to invert/flatten faction composition compared with Workbench expectations.
  - Character liveness checks should read `CharacterControllerComponent.GetLifeState()` first and only use damage-manager state as a fallback for non-character entities. Newly spawned or fallback AI characters can report usable character life state before damage state is meaningful for convoy/physical-war proof.
  - Game Master/editor placement uses the editor path, not the HST physical-war service path. If editor-placed squads only appear after camera movement, inspect streaming/editor placement addons or native editor activation first; do not assume the HST active-group population guard is involved unless HST spawn logs appear around the placement.
  - Runtime AI contact probes need a real elapsed-time window. Spawn opposing groups, assign normal `AIGroup.AddWaypoint()` search/destroy or move waypoints, then let the standard service tick sample live counts and distance over time instead of trying to prove combat inside the same script call. Treat waypoint assignment/contact distance as setup/contact evidence and live-count loss as separate casualty-resolution evidence; the latter should remain WARN/FAIL if the AI never damages either side during the timed window.

- Entity-follow behavior needs an entity waypoint, not a static move waypoint.
  - The base-game pattern is `SCR_FollowGroupCommand`: spawn `{A0509D3C4DD4475E}Prefabs/AI/Waypoints/AIWaypoint_Follow.et`, cast it to `SCR_EntityWaypoint`, call `SetEntity(target)`, then `AIGroup.AddWaypoint`.
  - A patrol hierarchy waypoint such as `{FBA8DC8FDA0E770D}Prefabs/AI/Waypoints/AIWaypoint_Patrol_Hierarchy.et` only moves to the sampled position. Keep it as a last-resort static move fallback, but do not expect it to remain bound to a moving player or vehicle.
  - Do not assume `SetPriorityLevel()` is available on a generated `AIWaypoint`. If a waypoint path compiles as base `AIWaypoint`, omit the priority call or keep it behind a compile-proven `SCR_AIWaypoint` path. Workbench reported HST captive follow calls as `Undefined function 'AIWaypoint.SetPriorityLevel'`; adding the waypoint plus movement type/formation was the compatible path.
  - After adding a follow waypoint, apply `AIGroupMovementComponent.SetFormationDisplacement(1)` so the follower stays close to the target instead of regrouping at a loose formation offset.
  - A direct `AIBaseMovementComponent.RequestFollowPathOfEntity()` or entity-follow waypoint can accept without producing movement. Track owner progress while the target is outside the close-follow distance; after repeated no-progress ticks, skip direct follow for that update and force a refreshed static waypoint at the responsive follow position. Keep the entity-follow waypoint as the preferred path when it is making progress.
